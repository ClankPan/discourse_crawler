My thesis is that current "tokenomics" are broken for investors. They work wonderfully for builders but not for investors. Many or most builders need investors to use their products, and so what is bad for investors will in the long run be bad for builders and therefore the network.

Assume we're burning about 18 billion cycles per second right now. At that rate we burn about 20 ICP per hour, or 480 per day, assuming that we are burning at these prices. And we're minting approximately 111,000 ICP per day through voting/staking rewards.

Now we have about a year and a half of the VC 1.5 million ICP monthly dumps left. This means at current prices we need to burn 6700 ICP per hour to keep up with this along with staking rewards, which is 335 times higher than we're burning now. And that would keep our circulating supply from increasing. 

If ICP increases in price the number of cycles increases proportionally. At 10x the price we need to be burning not at 335 times our current rate but 3350 times our current rate just to not have increasing supply, assuming only 1.5 million ICP unlocks per month.

This is obviously broken for investors, as there remains significant downward pressure on price until usage increases immeasurably. Now I know many people here don't care. You may have been an early investor who bought at $.03. or may be benefiting from how cheap it is to build on ICP. But a lot of us are not.

As a representative for retail investors I believe this is at least worthy of discussion. I am suggesting that we significantly overhaul tokenomics for the time being to alleviate the downward pressure on price. I am not sure how to do this but here is one set of ideas:

* Proposal: unlock all neurons immediately.
* Staking rewards are to be set to equal half of the cycles burned daily in terms of ICP, split proportionally between voting neurons. 
* Neurons are never locked. To vote you simply have your ICP in a neuron which can vote, and the rewards for voting are (as stated above) a weighted proportion of ICP equal to half of the cycles burned in the previous day.
* Node provider rewards remain on their current schedule, unless somebody has a better idea.

This change would be disastrous obviously. Why would I propose a disaster? Well, I am trying to start a discussion. We would have almost 200 million ICP unlocked immediately, after which the tokenomics would become more favorable.

I understand that there could be backlash, anger and shock at these suggestions. But my goal is to propose a set of incentives that don't just benefit the "VC investors" and builders, but also lead to sustainable price movement for investors. Right now we have two of the three, which I believe is harmful for the ecosystem as a whole.

Please discuss. I am not making a proposal (as I did once with suggesting all seed investors' neurons be locked for 8 years) but want to foment discussion and draw attention to the significant financial toll ICP has taken on investors. To dismiss these concerns is naive and short-sighted, as the project cannot thrive if investors are scorned.

Thank you.

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-07 21:36:13 UTC | #2

I agree that the tokenomics are unfavorable for non-early investors, but I wouldn't group the unlocking schedule together with this. Honestly, the unlocks for the next 1.5 years aren't that much of a problem, they don't increase the total supply, but only the circulating supply.

However, I do think the cycles mechanism/reverse gas model make it so that devs and users benefit from the ICP while non-early investors do not. I don't think it's necessarily a problem since the idea is to provide devs and users a general purpose web3 blockchain instead of enriching investors, but I wish I would have thought this all through before buying at around 40 dollars.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-12-07 21:38:26 UTC | #3

Thank you for the response. I am unsure about what solutions could be, which is why I want to have this discussion. Hopefully the community and team could come to a win-win scenario here.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-07 21:54:11 UTC | #4

That would be amazing. The reverse gas model is a big positive, little doubt about it. How it relates to the ICP token price is questionable though.

If a higher token price means a lower burn rate, it seems that any price growth will automatically be severely slowed. But I'd love to hear other's opinions on this.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-12-07 22:02:55 UTC | #5

What I am looking for is the "holy grail" of tokenomics - something that works for everybody. A win-win-win scenario. And I think what we have right now is not the winning formulation. This is why I want this discussion, and I hope that anybody with any ideas will come forward to contribute. Thank you all!

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-12-07 22:08:15 UTC | #6

Looping in @Zane as he has also had some great posts on tokenomics/IC operational profitability estimates.

If you are concerned about 1.5 M tokens being sold on the open market monthly, what leads you to believe dumping in excess of 100 million would prove any fruitful results? I must admit, such a proposal seems outlandish and ill-conceived. (Perhaps this is your intention to garner discussion?)

Correct me if I'm wrong here Smaug. "Dumping 1.5M tokens monthly is bad for circulating supply." I think most would agree with you here.

Thought provoking discussions revolving around *Why* seed investors are dumping is more fruitful. We should be collectively discussing *how* we can encourage those to restake. (My personal opinion)

Some half-baked thoughts (Have not deep dived on implications):
- Reduction in rewards curve for delegated voters. Can we conceive a model in which delegated votes (i.e - votes dedicated to yourself for example) would be less than manually voting? Such a model must result in growing voting power/rewards, but perhaps not proportional to manual voters?
- Reduction in flat rate for node providers (Literally not educated enough to come to conclusions here, nor even if such a proposal is viable. Just trying to spur discussion)
- Rewards proportional to burning mechanism? (I personally like this approach very much, but fear such a massive overhaul would be critiqued as "blasphemy" for those who have already staked 8 years - rightfully so. Would need to be extremely robust plan before we could even consider imo)

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-07 22:08:26 UTC | #7

The main question in my opinion is how do we keep dev costs cheap enough while simultaneously having a viable path towards deflation, without hampering token appreciation.

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-12-07 22:09:55 UTC | #8

Yes, I just want a discussion! I hope that we can come up with ideas on how to improve the protocol. I was just sharing my thoughts for one avenue which would of course come with significant problems.

I doubt anybody would say that the "tokenomics" are perfect. This is the place to propose improvements. Thank you for your contributions.

I think the idea of reducing delegated vote reward in favor of manual votes has been discussed, with the conclusion that some people could game that by writing bots or code to make sure they vote on everything.

Reduction in rates for node providers is an idea worth discussion and is admittedly out of my realm.

Rewards proportional to burn was in my initial suggestion, but yeah the long term stakers would be upset about such a decline in rewards, which is why I suggested unlocking all neurons so we could get a fresh start. But that comes with significant problems.

Thank you.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-12-07 22:31:10 UTC | #9

Got ya - thanks for clarifying here Smaug.

Let me continue:

I've similarly discussed in many threads why I believe circulating supply is something our community should tackle. I'm (personally) not interested in "This is a bear market" hot-takes. 

In addition, I'm also not in the game of trying to determine how an increase of purchasing of our token on exchanges will impact market dynamics. (For which I have literally no idea, and I don't think anybody does)

Encouraging seed investors to participate in re-staking is hugely important imo. They dont believe this is a viable investment? They have already made such a crazy amount of money they literally don't care about the IC anymore? They are using their rewards as a flywheel for other investments? Nobody really knows.

Thus, would be great if as a community could engage with the largest proponent of seed investors to collectively understand why they would prefer to dump (Again, basic instinct would suggest they already made boatloads. They simply don't care about future potentialities when they can just lock in real fiat now)

Further, I assume many would not want to participate in such discussion as they would fear it would result in our governance taking steps to prohibit their rewards. 

So again, this rabbit hole leads to the same conclusion. How can we *encourage* those early seed rounds/Strategic Rounds/Private sale participants to consider re-staking?

I'm honestly not quite sure.

*Sorry for all the edits! Poor spelling lol*

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-07 23:36:33 UTC | #10

If we assume a 1 trillion market cap and 5% inflation rate, we would need $50 billion worth of cycle burns. Is there a way to calculate, for example, AWS computation load to what it would be in cycles? Or AWS computational load in dollar terms?

That might give a rough example of ICP's burn rate at mass adoption. Or am I thinking too simple?

-------------------------

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-07 23:53:47 UTC | #12

I have metioned this question for N times, but Kyle and Dominic still think they will success,
Under this tokenism, ICP price is a disaster.
ICP will never be successful, it will never becomes deflation. We can imagine what will happen if a token has unlimited huge inflation forever but without enough burning rate to destory the inflation.
copared with inflation, the cycle burn rate is too small, token will become more and more, it already goes into a death spiral.(price shows)
no matter whether people choose to merge or unlock their maturity neurons , the new tokens has already been generated, and finally will be released. I am so desperate about ICP price under such a terrible tokenism.
but the Difnity team don’t care about it. they only care about make money from huge inflation.

-------------------------

I have heard lots of people are afraid of ICP tokenism. it makes them keep far away from ICP.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-08 00:12:42 UTC | #17

that is because the Dfnity team never listen to community advise, they just repeat tech day by day, they still don't realize how bad the tokenism, it will destory whole project, Nobody want to see icp keeping going down, but tokenism makes it keep falling.

-------------------------

InsaneClownPosse | 2022-12-08 00:24:57 UTC | #18

If it works to get their attention then keep spamming tbh. But I'm not sure it'll work.

I do remember the nns spammer did eventually get the attention needed to the nns spam problem so maybe this works too I guess

-------------------------

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-08 00:30:24 UTC | #19

I hope so, but I mentioned so much times in appropriate way, there is no feedback. 
we all know how to calculate the real burned ICP and inflation every year.
they still use LP staking and merge maturity ICP to oppose us. don't they know those ICP will finally released ?

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-12-08 00:41:14 UTC | #20

Nice topic, and I like your approach to finding solutions @smaug 

I think I'm still in my first year of thinking about tokenomics, so please excuse brain farts.

I don't really like any of the solutions completely yet, but to frame it a bit:
- reducing voting rewards turns down inflation and harms investors (which is risky)
- reducing node providers' rewards does it too, but has existential risk (which is very scary)
- increases burning turns up deflation, but harms devs (which is quite scary)
- linking burning to minting feels smart but could just cause problems with both areas

I like the input-output type system because it seems to give a natural velocity to ICP. I would normally be more wary of manipulation, but I am so impressed with the NNS as a concept, that I think it can work. Lots of assumptions, but we need to start from somewhere.

I think any solution will need to have some creativity if it is truly to be win-win-win. My prediction is that this cannot be found simply but arranging the existing pieces. Something new must be introduced, so the question is what? 

This could be an additional route for burning cycles, perhaps one related to the externalities produced by the canister. These unwanted, but sometimes unavoidable, outputs could be taken as costs. These could be environmental (carbon footprint, life cycle impact), organisational (exclusivity) or even social - I can imagine that, while the canister shows advertising to make money, there is also a cost imposed due to the negative effect that these have on the concentration or happiness of the person seeing them.

Another sword I would like to throw in is demurrage, or a cost associated with holding or owning a currency. It fell out of favour a hundred years ago, but I could see it coming back as an interesting tool for programmable money. Did you know that Norweigan bank notes expire?

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-08 01:00:35 UTC | #23

For your question, I want to ask, which chain like ETH and Solana, Avalanch, Dot, does take their Funding to developers to help their eco increase based on inflation token?
No, neither of them do this. they just directly use their funding to give money to developers. but what Dfinity team do? they only use inflation to give developers, their token become more and more.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen2 | 2022-12-08 01:07:31 UTC | #25

* reducing voting rewards turns down inflation and harms investors (which is risky)
if the price keep going down, no matter what amount the investors get is meaningless
* reducing node providers rewards does it too, but has existential risk (which is very scary)
it dese not affect node providers rewards, because their rewards based on real currency. I think u don't have deep understanding of ICP tokenism .

* increases burning turns up deflation, but harms devs (which is quite scary)
this should be paid by Dfinity funding. Any chains do this work. like ETH and DOT, and so on.
only do this can help price pump up which is good to Dfnity funding. They can rely the huge inflation token every year to paid for developers. that's totally wrong.

* linking burning to minting feels smart but could just cause problems with both areas
Any change should make the whole community memebr good. if keep working like this, situation will become worse and worse.

It seems that Dom and Dfinity don't care about this, they only care about the technology, but they don't seem to understand that if this doesn't change, at some point there will be no liquidity for ICP, which in turn will lead to it won't cost enough to keep running the giant machine Dfinity and it will collapse no matter how good the technology

Sabr | 2022-12-08 02:36:29 UTC | #41

@willguest, good summary of some of the key options. @smaug, good topic for discussion.

Before the SNS ecosystem rolls out with some high-utility token launches, along with the BTC, ckBTC and other integrations built into new dApps -- all burning a lot more cycles and ICP -- it is difficult to estimate what a baseline burn rate even looks like in the IC. So how can we really judge how long it could be until a deflationary scenario becomes possible? Therefore, I think we should hold off on any major tokenomics proposals until this baseline burn rate and SNS ecosystem growth comes more clearly into view. Naturally, this can only happen after this bear market and crypto winter are over.

That said, one thing I see no value in maintaining for almost everyone is the lockup on seed/early investor tokens. (FYI - I am **not** one of these individuals, so I'm not speaking from a desire to sell these locked tokens.) This slow monthly unlocking process is obviously bad for these early investors, since they clearly want to cash out but are prevented from doing so only because of a lockup that they had no choice to avoid. This is a critical point, since all other investors after genesis made a deliberate choice to stake their tokens for a specific dissolve delay that they also deliberately chose. 

The key difference here is *choice*, since choice should ultimately matter. I understand the temporary benefit of locking seed/early investors right after the genesis frenzy, but we are now over 1.5 years past this launch and well into a crypto winter.

However, what is even worse is how this restriction on seed/early investors actually deters any new (or existing) ICP investors who want to make their very first investment in ICP. This is where I am speaking about myself. I have been doing my due diligence on the IC for about two months, and this slow grind down of the ICP price from this monthly release is a significant deterrent to making my initial investment. It is quite obvious that there is a slow motion price discovery process in play because of this monthly batch of unlocked ICP, so why should I invest until I know that this effect is no longer so dominant over the market price? 

This predictable effect is also what is causing so much FUD and hyperventilating around a "death spiral", which is **not** what is happening right now. We could quickly and easily get rid of this doomsday FUD by unlocking the neurons of these seed/early investors. Then everyone (not just new investors) could get a great chance to buy ICP at a real equilibrium price, likely at a significant discount to today's price.

So my simple suggestion for now is to remove the lockup on seed/early investor tokens (other than those owned by DFINITY or the ICA, if possible) and let them make their choice for the very first time whether they want to stay invested or to cash out. This will accelerate ICP price discovery so that we can finally arrive at a true price equilibrium. I see no benefit to anyone in denying them the choice that all other investors have had. Can anyone provide a significant reason why this proposal would not be a good idea?

-------------------------

Inch_Deen6 | 2022-12-08 09:59:56 UTC | #42

for waht you said, I can't agree, it already showed the situation keep going worse under nowadays situation.
Any bad thing can not be recovered to be good without any action.
We all know the tokenism is a big problem, if let it continue like this without any action. that's a disaster. This predictable effect is also what is causing so much FUD and hyperventilating around a “death spiral”, which is what is happening right now !

-------------------------

Inch_Deen6 | 2022-12-08 10:07:02 UTC | #43

what u said are only based on your guess without any data. but we all use real analysis data to show there is a big problem which listed in those post before.
The problem of tokenism is exist, why don't everyone recognize it and don't want to change it?
Dfinity fund is using inflation token to support developers, not like ETH and other project which is really consume their funding.  his token become more and more, which is not beneficial to token price. 
solving the inflation problem of ICP tokenism is urgently.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-12-08 11:45:29 UTC | #44

You'd need more than that, cause a % of the burn rate goes towards burning the node provider rewards.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-08 14:20:01 UTC | #45

Hi @smaug 
many thanks you for sharing your thoughts! Here is my initial feedback: 
[quote="smaug, post:1, topic:17156"]
* Neurons are never locked. To vote you simply have your ICP in a neuron which can vote, and the rewards for voting are (as stated above) a weighted proportion of ICP equal to half of the cycles burned in the previous day.
[/quote]
The motivation for current neuron design is:
* In order to participate in governance, users have to stake ICP for a minimum of 6 months. Via the dissolve delay bonus, users are encouraged to stake for longer times, which translates into higher voting power and voting rewards. 
* This structure provides an incentive for users to vote in the long-term interest of the IC. 

If we now abolish the minimum lock-up, as you suggested, we would loose this incentive, which I would find concerning. For example participants could vote in arbitrary ways and immediately sell their tokens, without bearing the consequences of their decisions.  Also what would we gain from your perspective? 
[quote]
* Staking rewards are to be set to equal half of the cycles burned daily in terms of ICP, split proportionally between voting neurons.
[/quote]
The underlying idea of this point seems sound to me. In the long run, we could consider linking voting rewards in some ways to the amount of burned cycles in a given time period (presumably minus the node provider rewards). Given that the IC is currently in a ramp-up phase with rapid growth, I would think that such a mechanism could be phased in slowly over time.  
[quote]
* Node provider rewards remain on their current schedule, unless somebody has a better idea.
[/quote]
There is already a separate discussion thread on node provider rewards [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/128). The latest proposal, in a nutshell, is to proceed in phases. Ad-interim, for generation-two hardware nodes, it is suggested to determine node provider rewards similar to the generation-one node rewards, but with a lower risk premium given that the IC platform is now established. In addition, we require a thorough review and discussion on a broader update.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen6 | 2022-12-08 14:20:21 UTC | #46

because i am a researcher on tokenism, i just want to know if the tokenism is suitable for every project.
For ICP, I really found the tokenism has a big problem. Any project hope that their ecosystem'r prosperity can take deflation. Pls remember this is crypto world not country. Any project and community's task is to increase the price of that token under the real expaned usage of that chain. 
Like BTC, we know it's constant number , it will never generated agian if it reach 2100 millions .
Like ETH, we know it is very useful in those Defi and at the same time, it's deflation. so we trust it will pump up agian and evem more higher in bull market.
I know some of u may say one or two project like Doge has also inflation, But it has Elon's support. and even though like that, Nobody prefer to hold it.

now, we all know, according the the price at 4$ icp, Cycle burn only can consume 100,000 icp per year.
but the real inflation is 40,000,000 ICP if all people release their maturity neurons . 
there is a huge difference between burned amount and inflation amount.

under such a situation, ICP is already into a death spirals. but Dfinity team don't recognize it is death spirals , they still think it is normal in the bear market.

To increase cycles burn rate,  keep inflation and consumpiton are almost same is the only way to solve it.
Dfinity fundation has enough icp to support developers like ETH foundation.  otherwise price will never pump up. i am not scare anyone.

Yes, you touch on a very important point here! It would be great if we could come up with an approach for rewards which distinguishes between manual voting and voting via following.

I am 8 years NNS stakers, No one hope ICP will go to death in long time. We just hope Dfinity team can receive community’s feedback and do some change.

No one says the tech is not good even excellet, but without a appropriate tokenism, alway skeep inflation is a disaster, because lots of developers and users will leave, they are afraid of this inflation token and price keep falling down. as I know. some of good projects team has already left, even though they develop a good dapps, no users come and their project token borned in a terrible ecosystem.

For this question, i think lock 30 days or one or two month is enough. the price is already has a big change during that time, just like ETH 2.0 staking only ask for one year. if people believe they will still stake their token.

"consider linking voting rewards in some ways to the amount of burned cycles in a given time period (presumably minus the node provider rewards). "

this is a good way, it's urgent now. people already feel afraid of inflation. And at least your team should give out a announcement to the market.

I agree that this is an important discussion which we should pursue. However before concluding on anything we would need to do much work. From my perspective, changes to tokenomics require a very careful analysis and syndication with the community.

-------------------------

Inch_Deen6 | 2022-12-08 15:17:43 UTC | #52

What i mean is not to reduce minimum time for participation in governance from 6 month to 1 month.
I mean, we don't need to set such long staking time like more than 3 years.
ETH2.0 staking is already shows us its success.  people don't know what will happen in such a long time.
like the situation now, Tokenism, NNS-1 released, expand more users, and dapps ,some excellent developers left, those problems are all make people lose faith. 

To be honest, Ur team don't know we all investors really have a beautiful dream that ICP will be successful in long time.
Dfinity should have knowledge in cryto market especially what factor affects user most and what factor will affect users to prefer hold its token.

Fisrt is the ecosystem's development, that's ture. 
Second is tokenism, at least it can't be in inflation without huge users at the beginning.

I recommend.  DFINTIY Team can suggest to give some inflation when the whole ecosystem is too fanaticism which means token is not enough, instead of give such huge inflation when its ecosystem is just at begainning.

Voting via following has higher utility than voting manually and we should promote following those with the proper knowledge to vote on particular issues over voting manually.  This is the simple economic principle of labor applied to governance and it is the thing that has driven efficiency.  A proper liquid democracy will have very little manual voting.

[/quote]

The concept of months as a lock-up period is an abstraction over what the proper implementation of this would be if were not confusing and hard to understand.  The proper implementation, given that everyone were smart and clear thinking and adequately technical, would be for your votes to determine your lock time. If you vote on something you should be stuck with a lock of 1.5x where x is the time it takes to implement the feature.  For exchange rate proposals this is very short.  For the ability to change your vote after your follow neuron has voted this is a very long time.

I'm not suggesting we do this because I think it would be too complicated and we have enough complication as it is, but...if we were going to do this, then if you vote on an item and claim the reward for voting, your neuron should be locked until the NNS votes to recognize that the implementation of the vote has been effected and deployed...then you'd take the time from the vote to the acceptance of the implementation and add 50% to neurons lock time.  This would require all voters to stick around for the consequences of their votes and makes people much more thoughtful about their votes as it may lock them up for a long time if it is a big, hard-to-implement feature.

Because this is complicated we choose to abstract to simple months...but it does expose us to cracks in the skin in the game mechanism, especially when accepted features are kicked down the road past 6months from acceptance.

Yes I agree that following is a powerful mechanism. My point is that it would be worthwhile to explore how we can create incentives for known neurons to vote manually and perform work for that (e.g. check replica upgrades). Would you agree with that statement ?

I completely agree with @skilesare, we shouldn't think about grading voters according to their manuality. It is not a good scale for determining the value of the action of voting.

The best leaders in the world know how to delegate decision, and where to delegate them. If we just make it about who is clicking the buttons, we diminish the whole affair.

@FranHefner, I probably agree with your conclusion, but the graph is a bit odd in demonstrating it.

What is this data based upon?

Possibly....I'd like the voting separate from the payment. You can pay for work...don't pay for votes unless you want professional politicians. :). 

We need ways to fund code reviewers, etc.  I think Known Neurons should trust individuals that have been paid to review and audit code/become an expert...but I'd prefer that the neurons themselves don't get paid.  Incentivize the thing you want to be done or what will happen is the other thing you incentivize.

This is just intuition....I can be talked off the position.

The distinction between governance in the real world vs. our abstraction is something to note. There are clear differentiators which incline me to believe Manual “Voters” should receive marginally more VP than delegated voters. Why? 
-	Real world governance – Pre-Elect officials bring forth that which they believe the majority desires. I, Imagine, vote in one of those participants. I have the expectation the elected official will deliver on their promises, but there is nothing binding them contractually or otherwise to perform their promises. 
The ultimate point here is that they are elected in on promises, and then action (hopefully) ensues. They are bound to this promise to ensure continued maturation in their political role (Ie – voted in another term)

-	Our Liquid democracy – I, Imagine, delegate my votes to Skilesare. (I do. Thank you sincerely for your service!) Skilesare & team performs real time work to vet proposals. In exchange for this immediately realized value, you are granted a greater proportion rewards. 

Somehow would need to be a static differentiator. Obviously would not be able to grow if more users allocate their rewards to you

Thinking out loud here. Manual voters would all receive the same rate here, 100%. Delegated voters would receive 80%. This is an independent from the VP you would be allocated. Only your rewards would be offset higher.
This would apply to anyone voting manually.

As is in the context of this thread narrative, such a proposal would have to result in the net reduction of rewards – thereby decreasing future Total Supply impact and spawned maturity. 

Final remark’s – you are performing work for me that is immediately recognized. You are performing a service on my behalf.  That “value” should be captured immediately upon implementation. (Perhaps for exchange proposals right away, and protocol deployments upon Alpha)

Many are concerned about the ICP token price but are you forgetting the Project and your vision of its future?

We are in a Bull market and all tokens are affected and have lost value but how low can the Market Cap go?

Let’s consider that many tokens are locked up and the owners are not able to sell their stake and can only watch as the token price falls but that doesn't mean we won't see the opposite.

This means that the Market Cap will or can only fall so much as we the investors can not go anywhere and the number of tokens will always stay the same.

I don’t believe we could unlock neurons as this could cause real damage and I doubt the powers would allow this to happen.

I myself like the ICP project and have taken advantage of the low token price and keep those tokens in the coin providers account to offset the price I paid on the locked tokens in my neuron and will see if this was a good choice in the future.

Others say they are going to start or consider spawning, instantly lose voting rewards and for those of us who still have not, extra rewards, so you should consider your actions if you believe in the project.

The question I will ask is why do we have a NNS?

If you put up a proposal and the proposal is accepted it will change nothing unless DFINITY makes those changes for you.

I have noticed lately a big change on the NNS voting where many are following and the team proposals being put up are executing within hours. There have been many proposals but less rewards.

I would like to know if others have found the same.

I feel the dynamics and setting of the NNS are just about right and should be left alone. Many discussions on economics have not resulted in a real breakthrough. 

I feel we should let the DFINITY Team continue the building of the IC and the rewards will come later.

As for the principal idea of the NNS it has been a failure in my opinion. Investing rewarded tokens into the CF or SNS is to me just going further down the rabbit hole of investing on projects that are risky, a game of chance or nothing new.

The only part of the project that is not performing at this time is burning which means we need a lot more using the IC network.

The mindset of DFINITY seems to be set on investing in new projects which is costly, risky and we see many programmers interested by the lure of funding but not any results that I am aware of.

When the IC does network a few larger projects and the NNS starts to work as designed then do you think the ICP token could explode in price like BTC or LTC, I don’t think so as they are about transactions where the ICP is just a tool.

It seems that the CF and SNS are our only choice but we need to see some better projects because I haven’t seen any great proposals on the NNS.

All projects should only be allowed onto the network through the CF or SNS and include projects that don’t need funding but are encouraged to offer token NNS owners investment opportunities as an idea. That means DFINITY should be marketing the benefits of the IC to the top 100 companies to come aboard. 

To sum up my thoughts:
(Too many tokens and not many rewards) = lousy returns
Current projects are great for DFINITY to test the network.

TokenIflationIsBad | 2022-12-08 22:21:51 UTC | #65

really can't agree with u any more. token is not constant. its total amount will become higher year by year.
defaltion is nearly zero. Even though you think one day there will come out a successful dapp on IC, but it still need cycles burn rate increase 400X times than now which can destroy inflation per year. I just calculate the data at price 4$. If price pump up to 100$, cycle burn rate needs to increase 10000x times, But we all know after one years' hard word since IC came out, so much dapps already come out, it's burning rate of ICP is only 100,000 per year. however the inflation is 30-40,000,000 ICP token released every year.
they really need to change

"consider linking voting rewards in some ways to the amount of burned cycles in a given time period (presumably minus the node provider rewards). "

This is the what i highly recommended . And I think no body will refuse this suggestion. It doesn't harm anyone because rewards are still distributed by  nns locking time, at the same time find away to keep balance between huge inflation amount with small burned deflation amount, And everyone should get appropriate rewards just based the development of IC ecosystem. At least it harm nobody, I truly trust this will help ICP pump up if IC continue to develop.
I hope team can make a plan or votes.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-12-09 14:44:25 UTC | #69

If I understand correctly, you are referring to raising the cost (in cycles) of computation. The reason I say it harms devs is because it increases the continous cost of running a canister, indefinitely. When using "harm" i only mean increase costs and shift the incentive structure, not that I think they are being aggressively targeted.

I expect that a lot more people will become devs on the IC than on any other hosting platform. The self-hosting model will be, imo, hugely popular, so it is spreading the cost wide, but affecting everyone.

I take the point through that a higher ICP price would directly benefit the devs too (if they are paid in ICP) but there are so many factors that can affect the price of ICP, that the majority of devs/people will have no control over. If the cost of computation goes up, however, you are sure to affect them and can only hope that ICP goes with it.

willguest | 2022-12-09 15:01:28 UTC | #70

Your post got me thinking :slight_smile: 

I think the point you make about rewarding the real work done by named neurons is right, but I also think that delegation is part of the design and should not be de-incentivised. In trying to separate these ideas, I would ask 'does the nature of the reward for the named neurons need to be the same as the reward for delegated voting?'

This is speculative and maybe has already been discussed, but what about rewarding named neurons with staked maturity? These entities are showing that they are community hubs and, one would think, are in it for the long term. Because of this, perhaps this would be an acceptable form of compensation for them..

Giving additional rewards to these neurons in the form of staked maturity is, in effect, restricting the availability of the new currency, so not necessarily increasing inflation, but still recognises the work as adding value. It might also separate the concerns - both values could be tuned without affecting each other.

@skilesare very curious to hear your take on this.
@Denis is this related to the proposed system you mentioned? do you have a link to this discussion?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-12-09 15:26:58 UTC | #71

Staked maturity is better than straight ICP from a philosophical standpoint, but my mortgage company doesn't take staked Maturity. :joy:

If I'm receiving payment for doing good work for the IC I'd much rather it not be connected to how I end up voting...it just ties to many things to the vote and can create a crisis of consciousness.

Imagine a scenario where I analyze a pending change to the IC...I see that it will result in many more opportunities for me to vote and get rewards, but it isn't necessarily the best thing for the IC.  How do I vote?  I'd like to think I make the right choice, but I'm not confident most will.  I'd rather be paid for publishing my analysis separate from my vote so that I can give good recommendations and separate my economic vote from my system guidance.  Being able to change you vote after the followed neuron has voted will help this process as well.

As far as getting paid goes....I think we'll have natural ways this will emerge.  For instance...why don't node providers participate in replica deployment votes right now?  They have everything to lose! (The answer is that DFINITY controls all the votes....if they stopped voting the nodes would have to step up and invest funded in protecting their investment).

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-12-09 16:09:06 UTC | #72

@willguest it is sort of related. There were separate discussions on committee neurons and a very heated one connected with the Treasury. 
The essential dilemma is this: 
Dfinity have complete control of the replica code. At some point of time, some of the burden / responsibility has to pass to the community.
However, experts from the community will not do serious work on checking replica code unless they are compensated. So, where is that ICP going to come from?
The first suggestion was to slightly reduce staking rewards for everyone and give those proceeds to committee neurons, but lots of investors opposed that.
The second way hinted at was to fund it from ICP that would have gone to stakers but would not be minted because those stakers were not voting. That debate got pretty ugly.
A third way is for experts to be funded through voluntary donations. The question is whether that would provide the stable source of funding that it needed.

-------------------------

ImagineChadParadigm | 2022-12-09 16:09:39 UTC | #73

Hey @willguest, @skilesare - Thanks for conversing!

The voting power you receive is in essence, payment. Per your above conclusion, however, you differentiate the delegated voting power from the actual renumeration.

Which leads me to believe VP and remuneration from rewards should be independent, and not interdependent. Which is currently how it is…Darn that Dfinity team thinking of everything lol!

Allocating a portion of my rewards to you in the form of staked maturity is an extraction vehicle, but I don’t think I have a problem with it so long as the ceiling rewards structure remains.

If I’m receiving 20% voting rewards current state, but I choose to delegate my votes to someone else, I receive less? Could look something like this:

**Current state**

I Earn 20% rewards. Rewards are not indicative on person I allocate my VP to. Person I allocate to has higher voting power, but also still receives base 20% rate. (I.e same rewards rate)

More governance sway, static renumeration

**Future State**

I earn 20% rewards voting manually. I decide to allocate my VP to Skilesare. My Voting rewards drop to 15% for the service. Skilesare absorbs a portion of the difference (Say 3%) into a separate donation neuron. (As you already have a framework established as a not-for-profit) Skilesare continues to receive his normal 20% rewards from his manual voting. 2% is removed from ever maturing, thereby reducing the future overhang from spawned maturity.

More governance sway, Higher renumeration w/Ceiling model implemented.

I can see how this may create a conflict of interest for you as someone who votes on behalf of others. Given this, I think donations would be the most prudent form of giving.

I’m forced to choose someone that will vote in my favor, and you are incentivized to do so to receive donations. (Or payment, etc)

We are all still bound to ultimately vote in the best interest of the #IC in such a model as to sustain rewards. (Though I can see how this may create a conflict of interest to extract value in the short term at the detriment of the future state...)

Would be excellent if you could expand a bit on your analysis for replica deployment votes? Admittedly, not educated on this front.

NNS Neuron Marketplace:
Neuron holders that wish to sell their neuron for whatever personal reasons, should be able to place their neuron on a marketplace for others who are looking to invest further.

When I want to buy more tokens for my neuron I may be interested in neurons in a marketplace that would show the Neuron clickable address to view the main property values relevant to a purchaser.

The seller could then give a value price wanted or offered.

As I said in another post.

this is a good circle.
Deflation → less supply → ICP price up → more developers come in IC community → more ICP burned → more deflation

this is so-called death spiral (ICP is here !)
Inflation → more supply → ICP price down → more developers run away from IC community → less IPC burned → more inflation.
[/quote]

There is a conceptual error... you are associating a drop in price with a drop in activity and a rise in price with an increase in activity.

The cycles are a fixed value in USD, so at a higher price less is burned and at a lower price more is burned (inverse of what you say)

You are also seeing an activity growing in a very noticeable way (canister, burned cycles, projects, integrations). That is independent of the price.

The concept that the price determines the demand/growth of the space is wrong from my point of view. The price is a consequence of supply and demand factors.

lusfs | 2022-12-15 22:31:57 UTC | #93

Sadly, you're still hoping to deflate ICP by burning consumption. What you don't know is that its current burn amount is nothing compared to inflation. The plunge in ICP prices only brings about the loss of confidence and the loss of developers. Tokenism is so important in the cryto world, that's why ETH is deflation, Dfinity team can't understand this. Inflation brings more tokens, which causes the price of the currency to fall much more than the price of the currency caused by a little bit of deflation. You should better understand the magnitude of inflation and the magnitude of deflation.

I would like to see a temporary measure to have all voting rewards in excess of daily burn amounts paid by the Dfinity Neurons.  We could potentially lower the rewards rate and or raise the burn rate as well but the key is to have Dfinity pay the rewards instead of minting them.  

Voting rewards could also automatically be 'merged maturity' or else severely reduced if the owner wants to spawn a new neuron and liquidate as part of this temporary change in tokenomics.

The temporary measure will end when either 1) ICP becomes deflationary or 2)Dfinity owns less than XX% of ICP tokens.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-17 22:20:35 UTC | #98

Would you please share how you are calculating your data?

By my calculation, we have...
493,107,308 Total ICP Supply today (all ICP that has ever been minted)
469,213,683 Initial ICP Supply at genesis
23,892,625 Total ICP minted after genesis
[source - ICP Supply chart](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation)

There have been 585 days since genesis

23,892,625 / 585 / 24 / 4 = **425 ICP minted every 15 minutes**
This by itself is a lot less than the 1100 ICP you claim are minted every 15 minutes

I'd also like to know how you would account for the ICP that has been locked in 8 year neurons since genesis.  There has been 124,207,000 total ICP locked in 8 year neurons that are not dissolving in the last 585 days.
[source - Staked: Not Dissolving chart](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons)

If I apply your high level logic, then that amounts to...
124,207,000 / 585 / 24 / 4 = **2,209 ICP locked long term every 15 minutes**

This is ICP that is off the market for a very long time (virtually permanent for crypto) and it amounts to **25% of the total supply of ICP**...and it is still growing rapidly.

Perhaps that should be included in the inflation/deflation discussion since the long term time locked dissolve delay feature of ICP staking has an important role in this dynamic.  We still have a lot of dissolving genesis neurons hitting the market, but what happens when that runs out over the next 1-2 years?  The rate at which genesis neurons are releasing ICP to the market is already decreasing rapidly at this time.

Anyway, at the very least I think it is a much more nuanced discussion than a simple look at mint and burn ratios.

-------------------------

lusfs | 2022-12-18 02:03:51 UTC | #99

because what u calculate is just the number released out. but there are some people select to merge their maturity neurons, so those part of ICP have not been released out, but they are already existed, and will finally come out.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-18 03:21:15 UTC | #100

I agree.  Many people do choose to merge maturity instead of spawning maturity.  Both are minting events which contribute to the increase in total ICP every day.  That means that a significant fraction of the 425 ICP that is actually minted every 15 minutes is minted into a locked neuron and unable to come out for a long time and has zero impact on supply/demand balance that has you concerned about ICP price.  Minted ICP that actually hits the market is probably happening at a rate closer to 150 ICP every 15 minutes.

The real inflation rate for ICP has been 5% **total** since genesis, which is 3.2% **annualized**, including all minting from merge maturity, spawn maturity, and node provider rewards.  That's pretty low.

46,224,976 ICP are in dissolving neurons with a dissolve delay 0 - 1 years.  
[Source - Staked: Dissolving](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neurons)

46,224,976 / 365 / 24 / 4 = 1,319 ICP will unlock every 15 minutes for the next year (it's not evenly distributed, but hopefully sufficient to make the point).  In my opinion, that's the real source of your concern because it has far more impact on price than minting events.  I wish there were a way to incentivize genesis neuron owners to stop dissolving and increase their dissolve delays, but there isn't one that the community has ever embraced.  Nonetheless, that's the problem that could be solved that would actually make a difference.

-------------------------

lusfs | 2022-12-18 03:52:24 UTC | #101

No, even though they merge their maturity neuros, it doesn't mean those will be locked for just one year, this stituation like what u said will happend every year, so it's not just for next year. because some people merge their maturity neuros to their locded one year neuros, but some for two years, then thress years......

the problem is Dfinity team and Dominic never think this is a problem, they still believe they can make it into deflation through increasing cycle burn rate. but it's only their dream.
at this situation ICP price will be lower than 0.3$.

Brightcaterpillar | 2022-12-18 05:35:44 UTC | #103

The total inflation should be closer to 11% if included maturity. Even though maturity is just accumulated (exclude staked maturity),  those maturity can be spawned to new neuron with ICP minted in just 7 days.

We could have 3.2% annualised inflation currently, but this can easily be more than 10% if majority spawn maturity this year. I think this is what they would like to take into calculation rather than having inflation hidden with technical referrence to only actual minted ICP. 

Imagine we have annualised 3.5% for years, and suddenly one year we have >20% inflation due to large majority spawning their maturity all at the same time. I agree the data on inflation is not wrong, but it's misleading for some especially for those that doesn't know inflation can significantly change in just 7 days by spawning maturity.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-12-18 18:44:07 UTC | #104

This is a valid argument and does have me concerned.  I agree there is risk with the accumulated maturity that is just sitting in neurons doing nothing right now.  I’m a little surprised we haven’t seen very many unexplained minting event that could be triggered from whale maturity so far.  Fortunately, it hasn’t really happened.  All we know is that over half of the earned maturity has not been minted, which means actual inflation remains low.

I hope that many of the genesis neuron owners saw value in the new Staked Maturity option and have put their maturity to work for themselves instead of minting it and having to pay taxes.

Denis | 2022-12-18 19:09:49 UTC | #105

There is really no excuse to exclude maturity from inflation, especially when the changes to this total are easily available since inception on the [Circulation tab of the dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation). That nearly 50M in maturity represents a current (not just future) claim on the aggregate market value of the ICP token economy, just like the falsely-named "non-circulating supply" does. Therefore, in total, that means there are roughly 493M + 50M = 543M ICP *effectively* outstanding right now (excluding the minor maturity modulation % on the 50M, which will ultimately be irrelevant).

So even at a token price of $3.50, that translates into an ICP market cap. of about $1.9 billion. That still seems pretty rich for a token economy that generates only about $350,000 in recurring revenue (i.e., deflation) by burning about 100,000 ICP/yr. That said, there is no valid baseline yet for this nascent token economy, which is effectively launching itself during a crypto winter (via the SNS ecosystem, BTC / ckBTC integrations, etc.). So groaning about what sky-high annualized growth rates are necessary to boost this $350K/yr. to a level that can justify a $1.9 billion valuation (or much higher) is far too premature.

I believe it should be 493M + 50M - 20M (this is maturity that already converted to ICP) = 523 M

That's what I thought at first too, until I was corrected on this point, after which I strongly suggested that they change the misleading caption on this chart to make this more clear. In effect, *all* "maturity", by definition, is still unconverted, so the real total of ICP should be 543M, not 523M (or thereabouts). Apparently, that is what this graph shows: only existing maturity that has *never* been converted up until each date on the X-axis. If there is someone from DFINITY that can definitely state otherwise, then please speak up now.

What about "staked maturity"? Does it also count towards the amount of tokens in circulation?
At staking maturity, as I noticed, no mint transaction is performed. If it's like I think, maybe it's worth considering a new option in NNS: "merge ICP stake to staked maturity"?
It would burn tokens from the neuron's account in exchange for increasing the "staked maturity" which technically is only a value of the neuron, not a token in circulation.

I hope I didn't say anything stupid, I'm more of a theorist than a technical expert.

My understanding of staked maturity is that it becomes locked in the neuron with the same dissolve delay as the neuron that earned it.  It is not minted ICP.  It does add to the voting power of the neuron, which means it is able to perform work for the owner without a taxable minting event.  It benefits ICP economics because it mitigates liquidity of the maturity.  Staked maturity can only be minted once the neuron fully dissolves. 

I would love to know how much maturity that has been earned has been converted into staked maturity.  It would be nice if they add that trend to the dashboard.

I think @wpb accurately answered your question about maturity inside of a staked neuron, which is effectively compounded into more maturity *as if it were minted* (even though it hasn't been minted yet). I agree with him, by the way, that it would be nice to see how much prior maturity has been converted into staked maturity vs. being minted, which the dashboard currently doesn't show.

In addition, I think the link below should address your other question about what are "tokens in circulation". I too was under the mistaken impression that "non-circulating supply" was equivalent to the staked supply (+ perhaps unminted supply in maturity), but this is not correct. The "non-circulating supply" is more or less just an irrelevant subcategory that refers to unvested tokens at genesis that have not yet been subjected to any staking decision by their neuron owners. This number will eventually drop to zero as vesting continues at most until 49 months after genesis (see another section in the page linked below for the tokens distributed prior to genesis). 

All of the "non-circulating" and staked ICP represent currently outstanding tokens with a claim on the ICP market value, so all of them must be included in the market cap. calculation for ICP. This is contrary to the extremely incorrect market cap. for ICP shown on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/internet-computer/), along with all the websites (like Yahoo Finance) that rely on this incorrect calculation, which is about 50% too low.

Thanks, although I hope that in the future it will not work so that we send our ICP to a neuron account that has a temporary block of funds if we want to increase our stake.
Instead, the funds should be immediately burned and converted to maturity. The question of which tokens are actually in circulation and which are staked would be clearer.

Transaction Stake 1 ICP Neuron after such a change triggers transaction burn 1 ICP, and creates a neuron with "ICP Stake 0 ICP" and "Maturity 1". Then the Neuron account balances could be burnt and converted entirely to Maturity at the rate of 1 ICP = 1 Maturity.
If the Neuron had a Dissolve Delay it should be "Staked Maturity" instead of the normal "Maturity". As "Dissolved", it would just have a regular "Maturity".
I remind - "Staked Maturity" aren't minted ICP Tokens, so this would reduce the total circulation supply.

What do you think about it? Is it good idea?

Why would you want your staked ICP burned and converted to maturity? That doesn't make any sense to me, so I would tentatively have to say it is not a good idea.

As an FYI, I think the main reason why maturity is not automatically minted (or mintable at a fixed rate after being earned, without any variable "maturity modulation" factor) is to make sure that the earning of maturity is not a taxable event, particularly per the IRS in the U.S. This is the same reason why merged maturity into a staked neuron also remains staked automatically. If staked maturity were extractable from the neuron upon being earned, it would likely become immediately taxable as a result of the gain (or "income") becoming accessible to the taxpayer.

This fund belongs to people. You can't just burn it.

Does unclaimed mean that the maturity hasn’t been automatically staked or that it has not gone to a neuron (which I don’t see how that could be possible)? If it is the former then it definitely should not be burned. If it is the latter, provided that certain maturity to a specific neuron has not been claimed >1year then burn it.

I wouldn't wan't anyone to mess with my earned maturity without my authorization.

Why don't you make a proposal for what "should be" done and we'll see how many Adopt votes it gets?
