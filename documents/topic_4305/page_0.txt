I brought this up here but that thread has gotten long and there are multiple conversations happening:

I would like to be able to decide which HTTP status code is returned from `http_request`.

I think you can? The candid type has
```
type HttpResponse = record {
  status_code: nat16;  // Status text is derived from this.
  headers: vec HeaderField;
  body: blob;

  streaming_strategy: opt StreamingStrategy;
};
```

Excellent. Iâ€™m not sure how I missed this but will revisit and confirm.

Thanks Joachim!
