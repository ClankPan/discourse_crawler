The other canister functions accept `RpcServices` but the `request` function only a single `RpcService`. Is this intentional @rvanasa?

```
  pub async fn request(
    &self,
    arg0: RpcService,
    arg1: String,
    arg2: u64,
  ) -> Result<(RequestResult,)> {
    ic_cdk::call(self.0, "request", (arg0,arg1,arg2,)).await
  }
```

This is intentional; here is a quick explanation of the difference. Canister methods such as `eth_getLogs` include built-in agreement logic between multiple RPC providers, and in some cases they may call each API several times. The details are abstracted away behind the scenes. 

On the other hand, the `request` method sends a raw JSON request to one specific RPC provider without transforming the input or response. This is intended for use cases which require custom agreement logic between providers (e.g. if using a non-standard RPC method or provider).

This is explained in more detail in the [EVM RPC documentation](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/multi-chain/ethereum/evm-rpc/how-it-works).
