I am trying to use the `from_candid` and `to_candid` methods in a lib I'm working on, but I get these errors whenever I compile my code using the Motoko compiler in the vessel bin folder.
```
prim:50.30-50.42: execution error, to do: FromCandidE
prim:50.30-50.42: execution error, to do: ToCandidE
```

I tried running the code in Motoko Playground, and it works fine.
I also updated the compiler to version `0.7.3`, but it still returns the same errors.

This behavior looks like itâ€™s specific to the interpreter:

https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/cdd0279b8f41e03bd7433923ca2a21c46a7d79d5/src/mo_interpreter/interpret.ml#L410-L411

I think thatâ€™s `moc -r`. Is that what youâ€™re using?

Yes, that's what I'm using.
```
$(shell vessel bin)/moc -r $(shell vessel sources) -wasi-system-api ./tests/*Test.mo
```

I think youâ€™d need to do something like this instead:

Thanks! It's working correctly now

Thank you @tomijaga, I pinged the Motoko folks to have a look

`Import expression found in unit body`

Thanks for the report. You didn't include a reproduction snippet, but we need something to reliably debug and fix this problem. Normally the syntax should ensure that import clauses are only appearing at the top of the file and their content gets properly resolved. In your report something unexpected is happening.

If you could provide some materials (can be a `git` repo too) that would speed up troubleshooting immensely.

I've added comments and links to the repo I was working on. 
The issue was I was trying to compile multiple files into a single object file.
I wrote a bash script to help me with it but is there any command for compiling and running multiple files
