Soooo now that we have a system that can check if we have humain behind adresses.. Isn't it time to be sure people investing in SNS are real people ?

Otherwise I see no point putting a maximum limit of ICP per participants since taking part of swap can be automated.

I'm mostly interested in applying these identity solutions to the NNS.

My read of the state of the art and decision making for these solutions generally is this: developers and decision makers are waiting for a robust, standard, stable solution to arise. Unfortunately the current solutions don't feel quite ready, and moving too quickly might not be wise depending on the project.
