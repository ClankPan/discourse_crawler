When I start the dfx replica I'm running into this on an Ubuntu server. Please advise:

Here's some additional details regarding the environment:

Please let me know if I can provide additional details

Thanks, I relayed it to the right team. Could you maybe try with 0.12.2-beta.0? There's a chance this is fixed in that version already

Wasmtime requires a CPU with SSE4.1 support. My guess would be that the machine doesn't have SSE4.1.

Could you please paste the output of the following command to verify this theory?
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep flags | head -n 1
```

If the CPU support SSE4.1 then, the output should contain `sse4_1`

Thank you @ulan

This is the output I received:

>flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 apic sep mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush mmx fxsr sse sse2 ht syscall nx lm constant_tsc nopl xtopology cpuid tsc_known_freq pni cx16 x2apic hypervisor lahf_lm cpuid_fault pti

I don't see `sse4_1` here so I assume this CPU/VM does not support running wasmtime.

As a follow on question, I assume this means anything requires running canisters is going to be unavailable including running the local replica.

Should it be able to run commands like `dfx build --network ic` or `dfx deploy --network ic`? Or are even these not likely to work?

+1

I think the commands that don't involve local execution of Wasm should work. But I am not 100% sure and it is better to try.

[quote="Severin, post:2, topic:17857"]
0.12.0-beta.0
[/quote]

Is this number correct? `0.12.0-beta.0` was released after `0.12.1`?

Also, I don't see that version [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/sdk/public-manifest/manifest.json) or [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/release-notes/). So, not sure if it's a valid version..

But, anyway, thank you for the help. @ulan helped troubleshoot the issue and arrive at the underlying cause.

No, I mistyped. I meant `0.12.2-beta.0`. Basically the latest version mentioned in the [sdk releases](https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/releases)
