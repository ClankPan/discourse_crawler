Hello can anyone guide me for development on some of the topics. I didn't found any guide, examples or even I saw some I might not have noticed.
How can a smart contract(canister) deploy a freshly smart contract(canister) ?

Also another question, A canister size is limited to 4 GB for now, If I have only used 100 MB of the storage can I shrink the size to remove unused space ?
edit: I'm using rust for development.

Here's example from @GLdev https://github.com/GLicDEV/quickstart_scaling/blob/ca9f581c270314670f6de92e25df3b6f87927a19/src/quickstart_scaling_index/src/businesslogic.rs#L342

You're only paying for memory you are actually using as long as you don't allocate additional space by setting a non-zero `memory_allocation` (See: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#ic-create_canister).
