the eeror: "An error occurred during Candid interface compatibility check for canister 'backend'."  is kind of too simple that make me hard to check where goes wrong.
Any good approach to fix that ?

It's likely that the did file you generated is empty.

Yes, its empty.If i use hand made generate. : cargo build & wasmtime  it is something like this :  
lake of function body:
```bash
# cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release --package "backend"      --features "ic-cdk/wasi"
# wasmtime "./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm"  > backend.did  --allow-precompiled

type Result = variant { Ok : text; Err : text };
service : () -> {
  get_caller : () -> (text) query;
  greet : (text) -> (text) query;
  next_id : () -> (nat64) query;
  now : () -> (nat64) query;
  register_user : () -> (Result);
}


```

Do you put this generated did file in `dfx.json`? e.g., `candid = "backend.did"`
