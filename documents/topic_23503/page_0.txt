Hi, is it possible to use the NNS WALLET on exchanges to trade straight from it without transferring tokens?
Is a bit confusing for new users that anytime you log in into an APP using the Internet Identity the principal changes.

No, unless the NNS dapp adds the capability to do so.

The principal actually is bound to the URL. You get the same prinpical every time you log in to the same service
