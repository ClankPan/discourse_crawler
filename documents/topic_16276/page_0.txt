Hello everyone!

This is not a proposal, just an explanation I was asked to give on Twitter: https://twitter.com/IsaacValadez55/status/1586441373125083136?s=20&t=3NtCFUrfRvA2p_nrPxLQ6g

## TL;DR
If the NNS needs to distribute ICP for "public goods", it should delegate the distribution to neuron holders by giving them "Goodwill ICP" in portion of their earned maturity. This is normal ICP, but the neuron cannot redeem it, they can only burn it or anonymously gift it to an approved "public good" source.

## Where did this idea come from?
I first mentioned it during this Twitter Live a few weeks ago, when discussing the NNS Treasury: https://twitter.com/icpjesse/status/1582401416366198784?s=20&t=5yIKQKKBQXH5KmTJZyvvTg

I then refined and built up the concept a bit more in person that weekend with other members of the ecosystem, right before the Code & State LA meetup started.

## Why is "Goodwill ICP" needed? When would it be used?
This concept is proposed as the preferred way for the NNS to distribute ICP, should it be in the situation where it needs to do so.

I don't believe an NNS Treasury should exist, but I don't like tearing down the solutions of others without providing anything useful to the discussion, so I came up with the "Goodwill ICP" distribution method.

I strongly believe it would be highly problematic for the NNS to ever distribute ICP directly to sources, using proposals. I also think it would be bad for any party to directly receive ICP from the NNS, since there are no market dynamics to hold it accountable for how the ICP is used.

In general, I think sweeping unilateral proposal decisions are a poor mechanism in many situations, and that complex decisions (such as funding) should be delegated to neuron holders and therefore held subject to market dynamics.

## Detailed Description
1. A DAO, foundation, or industry association would form, and submit a proposal to become an "approved goodwill ICP recipient". This would be similar to the process for becoming a known neuron, though ideally more rigorous. These entities should either fund public goods across the ecosystem, or directly provide them.
2. Any normal neuron can be delegated Goodwill ICP to gift out to NNS approved recipients. Neuron owners would select approved recipients to automatically gift their Goodwill ICP to, similar to how they would select neurons to follow. These gifts should be 100% anonymous so that nothing can be given in return. This should help reduce collusion, kick-backs, and gaming of the system. One default recipient would be a "burn" wallet address, so neuron holders can choose a reduction in inflation as the public good they would support.
3. The "Goodwill ICP" that's actually redeemable by an Approved Recipient would be quadratically weighted, so they would actually get less then they were gifted depending on how much in total was gifted to them in proportion to the other possible recipients (with the difference being burned). This means no whale public good funds would be able to hog all the Goodwill ICP and become a centralized power, and it also motivates neurons to diversify their recipients, especially by supporting smaller funds so that their goodwill ICP stretches further.

In the end, this means that market dynamics from the neuron holders would determine which public goods get funded. If a recipient does a bad job supporting the ecosystem or keeping promises, then neuron holders can remove their support. If a recipient starts getting a lot of funds, it requires a reduction in inflation since most of the gifted ICP will be burned (due to the quadratic balancing explained above).

## ICP Sources
* **"Abandoned ICP"** - (For the record, I am against this) In a nutshell, neurons are currently earning the rewards they were promised + the rewards non-voting neurons would have earned if they had voted. While I would prefer to see the "un-earned" ICP never be minted, if it was minted with the purpose of public goods, then I think allocating it as "goodwill ICP" for the neurons which are already currently receiving it would be the fairest way to distribute it to public goods.
* **DFINITY** - They could use Goodwill ICP to delegate the distribution of some of their grant funds to the community, rather than distributing it all directly.
* **Public Good Neuron** - The community could raise funds (using an NFT collection or something) for an 8 year neuron which can only be controlled by the NNS. We should add an "abstain" voting option (this is another proposal I'm planning), and then have this neuron always vote "abstain" so that it can earn maturity without impacting governance outcomes. Then this maturity can be distributed as Goodwill ICP for funding public goods.
* **Neuron Owner's Choice** - We could give neuron owners the ability to select a percentage of their maturity that they could automatically receive as Goodwill ICP, and then they could have this gifted however they wish. This may be good for tax reasons, or simply because they think reinvesting in the ecosystem will be the best way to grow the value of their ICP holdings.

Hi and thx for the work you put in to come up with a possible solution.

I like the idea and I have a few questions.
1. Is it necessary to convert the abandon icp to "good will icp" or  community icp so to speak?
They should never be minted in the first place. Lets keep it that way. It is just bad!

Lets have a clean solution. If someone votes or delegate actively every x month its vote to someone else, then he or she shall be compensated with minted icp.

2. DAO fundation do it as charity work?
- can they pay themself a salary for their work?
- who decide it to redeem the "good will icp" ?
- is it a non profit org?

3. Is it necessary that the staker shall get good will icp ? It is much better when they donate some of their rewards to a dao fondation. Lets keept it simple at first and see if additional "good will icp" are needed. Every additional icp creates an inflation and this must be compensate. Inflation is a bad instrument to fund projects.

By the way, the idea to give the staker the power to donate some of the minted icp rewards to a fund is good. This is also done in other projwlect in similar fashion.

4. How to cope or not to fall into micro management ?

Abandoned ICP, to my understanding, never needs to be minted in the first place. Personally, I'm with you and would prefer it stays unminted.

So the fund or organization would need to make it's business model clear and get strong support from the ecosystem to gain (and possibly even maintain) it's "Approved Goodwill ICP Recipient" status. In many case, I'm sure it's appropriate for them to use the funds to pay salaries and other expenses. If people don't like how they intend to use the funds, then they can send their Goodwill ICP elsewhere.

[/quote]

The whole "Goodwill ICP" thing is about giving neuron holders ICP they can only gift to public goods, otherwise it's just a normal airdrop/maturity. However, I agree that the best way to start is simply to enable the gifting of normal neuron maturity. If this isn't enough to cover needs, then perhaps it would make sense to start building out a full Goodwill ICP implementation.

**important remark**
I think this need  to be described in more details. It opens the possibility to misunderstand it.

The foundation DAO is responsible to select the most promising project (top 3, top 5, etc.) Right? Are they also responsible to decide how much the project shall be funded ? 

In this case, the decision why project x is funded with y dollars and not project z must be clear/transparent to all stakers (keyword: Detection of malicious behaviour)

Fair distribution is not always the best choice, but for starter it can be used and adjusted afterwards.

Well it can be structure however is best. A recipient may not even necessarily be a fund that gives out grants, it my be something like Departure Labs.

The main problem of the ICP is its inflationary. The icp, which was $750 a year ago, is $5 today. If ICP inflation will continue like this, after a year there will be more ICP everone, but the price of ICP will be $2. At that time, the wisest thing to do is to close the ICP to prevent inflation.
. Burning is in everyone's interest.

Well there were a lot of reasons for the token drop, inflation has basically been the same the whole time so I don't think that's been the core driver.

That said, I am against inflation by the NNS. Depending on where the ICP comes from, the Goodwill ICP distribution method may actually be a deflationary force on the tokenomics.

To summarize your proposal to make sure I understand it. The core components of your idea can already be achieved today with the following steps. 

Step 1: I create a 8 year neuron. 

Step 2: I market my neuron in the forum and elsewhere, and ask community members to donate their ICP to my neuron. I say "I am good at allocating ICP, trust me for reason x,y,z. If you send me ICP i will use it to fund x,y,z type of projects" 

Step 3. Some people are convinced by my promises, and they send their ICP to my neuron. 

Step 4. I receive ICP donations from the community to my 8 year neuron. 

Step 5. I decide who I want to send the maturity from the donated ICP to, pay myself a salary, and manage the distribution of funds as i see fit.  

The only missing pieces which would require changes to how the NNS currently works: 

- The creation of a special Permissioned "Goodwill Neuron" type that can only burn or gift ICP. Ie it can't be dissolved, and requires NNS approval to be created. The NNS approval would require me submitting a proposal to the NNS explaining why I am good at allocating ICP and trustworthy enough to control and create my own Permissioned "Goodwill Neuron". 

- The creation of an "NNS Approved and whitelisted ICP recipients" who are authorized to receive funds from "Permissioned Goodwill neurons". As the owner of a special Permissioned "Goodwill Neuron" I would only be able to distribute to a pre NNS approved list of recipients. For people to be added to this list, they need NNS Approval, which can be received by submitting a proposal explaining why they are trustworthy and should be able to added to a whitelist and allowed to receive funding from Permissioned "Goodwill Neuron" and are trustworthy".

- Implementation of a quadratic funding algorithm to adjust how much funds can be receive by certain whitelisted recipient. 

- debate over various ways of funding the special Permissioned "Goodwill Neuron" (either by donation, dfinity, public good neuron, abandoned icp, etc.) 

Did I miss anything or is this an accurate summary?

Are not required at the moment. At first it can be performed based on rewards only. Maybe the rewards are converted into good will icp. But I like it to keep things simple and stupid at first. Just minted icp donated by stakers.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-11-01 00:07:20 UTC | #15

Yeah that's what I was thinking. No special neuron type needed or anything to be a Goodwill ICP gifter. It's similar to the Community Fund model, but I think that's separated for tax reasons, and since gifting is already a tax exception I don't think that's necessary for Goodwill ICP.

[quote="Omaxus, post:13, topic:16276"]

So probably like every 6 months the automatic gift settings are reset for neurons and Goodwill ICP recipients will need to submit a proposal to maintain their status as an eligible Goodwill ICP recipient.

In this proposal they should explain what they've been doing with funds and argue for why they should keep their eligibility. If the community thinks they are wasting ICP (or not being transparent regarding it's usage), the recipient will either lose their eligibility to receive Goodwill ICP (the renewal proposal is rejected by the NNS) and/or gifters will simply start giving to other eligible receivers (normal market dynamics).

This covers things like salary without requiring micromanagement or specific built-in restrictions (which would over-complicate things). If you pay yourself too much, you risk upsetting and losing all your donors.

While the public good receivers of Goodwill ICP are nonprofit, they do need to be competitive in terms of providing some type of value to the ecosystem. Otherwise, why should anyone gift them ICP?

I agree with you that there shouldnt be a treasury, and I'd also like to see the unrewarded never minted.

[/quote]

**Salary**
We could use some kind of agent model.
If the treasury manager find a good project which becomes sucessfull, he get paid for the effort of selecting a successful project.

**Salary based on success**
It should also be clear how high their salary is. To hinder any rug pulls.
One can overestimate their ability and say I pay myself 1 million dollar salary for every successful project. In that case he or she should try to work for blackrock.
If the opportunity exits, then it is going to be exploit by 💯%.


**success as measurment**
What are the key properties or measurment on which a decision can be derived whether a project is successful or not?
Who makes the decision ?
Idk, but that should be approved through a proposal.

**Selecting a fund manager**
Is anybody able to get the role or some criteria has to be met? 
The why arguments should be very good formulated. Not only that, it must be transparent where the icp (and how much) is forwarded to a project. The project who gets funded has to do some meetings on regular basis too and provide information about their progress (as DFINITY is doing it right now) to hinder rug pulls.

The more I think about it the more complicated it gets.

I agree with starting with this much simpler implementation, it may be enough. Key to any kind of "donations" platform IMO is lack of friction. It must be incredibly easy to divert your rewards to other neurons, otherwise many people who might give will just decide not to.

The answer is tied to the comment below:

[quote="Omaxus, post:18, topic:16276"]

[/quote]

Keep in mind, the NNS is not deciding anything directly, it's just enabling a "gifting market".

Funding is an inherently complex thing, and both morals and politics quickly become involved. Restrictions which may make sense in some situations, won't make sense in others. These are all reasons why the NNS shouldn't allocate funds directly. It would be too slow to react to new information,  and receivers would not be easy to hold accountable fairly without an increasingly complex system.

While not perfect, the beauty of delegating the task to independent neuron holders is that we are now using market dynamics. Deciding the most efficient allocation of funds is what (well designed) markets do. Sure, a foundation might get away with over-paying some people for 6 months until it's time to renew their Goodwill ICP receiver status again, but then how are they going to explain where all that ICP went without risk of losing their gifters? A fund could also quickly lose all their gifters if they got caught up in a scandal. A market will always react way quicker then an NNS proposal.

We may even set it up so that a receiver automatically loses their Goodwill ICP recipient status if less than 5,000 Goodwill ICP is gifted to them a month. This means they need to keep the trust they earn from the ecosystem or risk losing it all. I don't think any more specific accountability measures are needed beyond that, markets root out inefficiency quickly and maintaining positive public opinion is hard.

Basically, built-in accountability measures will always be too complex. The best option is to let natural market dynamics handle that complexity. If they can't convince enough neurons to gift them Goodwill ICP, then they lose. If they can, and they maintain that trust, then they win. Let the Neuron holders decide.

This is the most frustrating thing about this...you can already do this! But dfinity won't add back the functionality into the NNS UI.  It is extraordinarily frustrating.  You can give a charity, or anyone really, control of your neuron. If this is an 8-year staked neuron, there isn't anything evil that they can do to you...you maintain control and can kick them off anytime you want.  It is called the "manage neuron topic" and dfinity could enable it back with one line of code. If you are a hacker you can get it to work now(see the dedicate a neuron topic on https://icdevs.org/donations.html).

It sounds like "Good Will ICP" is just one in which you HAVE to take this action or no maturity is earned.

This would also be a ten-line implementation where you can only assign manage neurons from these to non-profit neurons.

Did you know: Each neuron has a non-profit field?  I don't know how to get this bit flipped or I'd do it for ICDevs.  But the field is already there...and non-profits are the only neurons that can re-assign their controller.

-------------------------

aaa10247 | 2022-11-01 16:00:15 UTC | #23

Why not remove the NNS approval requirement for whitelisting and approving Goodwill neuron and receivers and instead make it permissionless?

A likely vulnerability is a dishonest party could easily create many NNS approved goodwill neurons, and NNS approved ICP receivers. The NNS voting to authorize certain permissioned addresses likely wouldn't be able to verify or prevent people from doing this. 

As a result, many neurons who get NNS approval to distribute goodwill ICP, and also those who get approved by the NNS to receive ICP goodwill are likely to end up being both controlled the same people. ie i can distribute funds to myself. 

If that's inevitably going to happen because the NNS cannot really have tools at it's disposal to verify otherwise, then why not do away with the NNS approval requirement entirely? What function is the NNS permissioning the creation of goodwill icp neurons and receivers performing? If individuals are making voluntary decisions to donate to a particular "goodwill neuron", then why does the NNS need to give prior approval on who I can donate my ICP to? Instead, why not allow anyone to create goodwill neurons, and become goodwill icp receivers without creating a gated NNS approval step?

The minimum viable implementation is to add check boxes next to "Participate in upcoming community fund" that instead read "Donate Maturity to XXXXXX" where XXXXX is a whitelisted Named Neuron with non-profit == true.  Clicking this takes three actions:  Asks the user what percentage of their neuron and then 1. Splits the neuron if necessary. 2. Adds the Named neuron on the manage neuron topic. 3. adds the named neuron as a hotkey.

The target organization can then harvest maturity at their leisure...they could start dissolving or split the neuron but that would just be a headache and/or produce less maturity so there is no reason to do so.

The command to do so is:

```
dfx canister --network=ic  call rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai manage_neuron \
"(record \
{\
    id=opt (record {id=14231996777861930328:nat64}); \ //controlling org neruon
    neuron_id_or_subaccount = null; \
    command=opt (\
      variant {MakeProposal=(\
        record {\
          action=opt (variant {\
            ManageNeuron=record {\
              id=opt (record {id =2012199716792119823:nat64}); \ // good will neuron
              neuron_id_or_subaccount = null; \
              command =  opt( variant {\
                Spawn = record{\
                  new_controller= opt(principal \"ufef3-ic2bp-enpmy-5ezyw-z4p5q-mzgsv-w24y3-2v2b6-ktjpk-cjik4-kae\")\ // controlling orgs principal
                }\
              })\
            }});\
          url = \"icdevs.org\";\
          title = \"donation\";\
          summary = \"donation\";\
        })\
      })\
  })";
```

If the user unchecks then the follow and the hotkey is removed.  User is free to merge the neuron back into their core stake.

This is a 100% UI-based change.(edit: actually I don't think there is a place for the org's principal so that would need to be added somewhere or the receiving org wouldn't know they had been donated to...this could be removed with a reverse look up query that lets a neuron controller find the neurons it manages on manage neuron topic.).

The only thing we'd need to be changed on the back end is to enable a neuron to identify as non-profit(and potentially a place for the controlling principal).(Or not if we want this open to for-profits as well).

I'm hoping we don't limit it to just non-profits, but any work that people feel they want to contribute to. I'm thinking of Demergent Labs, my company, which is a for-profit company but is focused on open source developer tools.

I think a minimal version of this is a row containing an input field for address and another for percentage of maturity. Users could add more rows with a button.

The address field would allow people to divert ICP to their own addresses if they wish. Some people need to allocate a percentage of maturity aside for tax purposes, and this is an ongoing and tedious manual process. This could also facilitate that by letting a user enter their own wallet address here.

I think the percentage part is important because otherwise it’s all or nothing, and that won’t work for everyone.

An address book feature would be nice for convenience but if this is just “set and forget” that seems like it could wait. I’d prefer to be able to manage the entries myself and not be limited to who I can send to though.

Ultimately there probably shouldn't be such a gate...I was just reaching for a quick path to implementation and that tag exists -for-some-reason-. I'd love to know what the reason was...if it has to do with the Foundation nature of DFINITY or something else.  

There are real legal rails for non-profits that may or may not make a difference to contributors, but I think ultimately it should be the contributor's choice.

This would be great, but my concern was that it required more backend code and storage for the NNS.  This is certainly the most obvious and straightforward representation of what is going on. I'd prefer this if it is implementable quickly, and ultimately prefer it long term if it doesn't drastically increase complexity.

Not sure what @aiv meant with "website refresh" but when it comes to what you wrote above @paulyoung - "An address book feature would be nice" - this is indeed in the backlog, we are aware that the community would like such a feature.

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-11-01 18:29:46 UTC | #32

I think more desirable is the ability to automatically redirect/donate a percentage of ICP from maturity to some addresses.

In that case, not sure such a feature - "redirect/donate a percentage of ICP from maturity to some addresses" -  is actually an initiative that I should forward myself - i.e. not sure it is the best channel, because I kind feel it has probably to do with the all NNS, not just the dapp but it might need changes in the governance canister, you know what I mean?

Moving maturity between would also be nice. It is planned for the CF, why not extend the feature and make it general purpose?

You can build an sns dao if it is so frustrating.

Yes, also agreed with this idea to move it to any adress. More general means also more flexible use cases can be build on.

why not allow anyone to create goodwill neurons, and become goodwill icp receivers without creating a gated NNS approval step?
[/quote]
Can you explain it in more detail what you mean with "can create good will at will", it opens the possibility to misunderstand it.

If i can convert my rewards to good will neuron than everything is fine.

The proposal describes a permissioned system, where NNS needs to whitelist applicants seeking to create a "goodwill neuron" and those seeking to "receive ICP sent from goodwill neurons". My comment was addressing whether not this is necessary. 

Does that clarify your question? 

Not sure what you mean by "convert my rewards to goodwill neuron".

No it doesn't. Any neuron would be able to get delegated Goodwill ICP to gift out, but only specific neurons would be approve as valid recipients of Goodwill ICP (this would be the entities providing public goods). This is just to prevent making it so that users can gift the Goodwill ICP to themselves. The whole NNS agrees which small set of users are actual valid recipients.

Just updated the topic to clarify it.

aaa10247 | 2022-11-01 19:58:45 UTC | #41

Okay thank you for clarifying. According to your proposal, the NNS would need to whitelist valid recipients of Goodwill ICP, but anyone can receive delegated Goodwill ICP.

If the purpose of the NNS whitelist is to "prevent users gifting the Goodwill ICP to themselves." I am not sure that a permissioned whitelist of valid recipients actually is able to achieve that goal.

**Neuron Owner’s Choice** - We could give neuron owners the ability to select a percentage of their maturity that they could automatically receive as Goodwill ICP, and then they could have this gifted however they wish. This may be good for tax reasons, or simply because they think reinvesting in the ecosystem will be the best way to grow the value of their ICP holdings.
[/quote]

A mathematical thought on this one. If the quadratic difference is burned then it is always in this person's interest to give directly as opposed to participating in the system. Even if you weigh the total and adjust the round and distribute quadratically without burning(so that the total available is the total that gets distributed) if the person giving has any prejudice one way or the other as to who gets the gift then direct gifting is advantageous.

I've created a pull request to add the Manage Neuron topic back to the NNS UI:

https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/1501

12 additional lines of code.

This would allow any user to donate their maturity to an organization by:

1. Adding the neuron on the Manage Neuron topic.
2. Adding the organization's principal as a hotkey.

FAQ:

Q: Can't the org then change the neuron? Who would do that?
A: Hotkeys+Follow on Manage Neruon can 1. vote 2. spawn maturity 3. start dissolve.  Do not do this for someone that you don't want to possibly vote for you(you can still follow and if they don't vote you'll be fine). Do not do this for someone that you don't want harvesting your maturity for themselves.  Someone who is harvesting your maturity will not want to start dissolving your neuron because they want to get max rewards. Do not do this for someone that may extend your lock date.(If it is already an 8-year neuron they can't do this anyway.)

Q: What if I decide I don't want them to have my maturity anymore?
A: Remove the following from the Manage Neuron topic and remove the hotkey.

Like I told you previously @skilshare on the forum ([thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/nns-dapp-ui-kit/16298/3?u=peterparker)), external contributions are not yet accepted in the dapp repo on the contrary of [ic-js](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-js/), the API layers of the dapp. Therefore the PR was automatically close.

If this is the outcome of the final proposal that would be accepted, we for sure take good note of it. However, as I said above ([post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-goodwill-icp-distribution-framework/16276/33?u=peterparker)) I have personally the feeling that anything discussed here might have more impact than "just" the dapp.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-11-02 10:51:21 UTC | #45

This feature was previously the dapp. I’m not sure why it hasn’t made it back in as it it is the key mechanism that a number of orgs use to mange their neurons. The pull request is there for any internal resources that want to internalize it.

I’m mentioning it in this thread because it accomplishes a significant amount of the intent of the thread without significant code changes.

What do you mean with "previously in the dapp"? You mean last year in NNS-dapp before the rewrite in Svelte?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-11-02 11:22:43 UTC | #47

Yes.  You have specific lines in the svelt to exclude this feature that I assume were ported over from the other dapp.

I was helping out with the NNS Dapp in the early days post genesis and I remember that we were asked to remove the ManageNeuron topic because proposals of that type are private, so people decided it didn't make sense to show that topic on the NNS Dapp.

We later added it back in only for neurons which already had followees on the ManageNeuron topic, because you couldn't merge neurons if either neuron has any followees on the ManageNeuron topic and all of the neurons which Dfinity were giving out came with followees on that topic. So in order to be able to merge neurons we allowed users to view the topic solely so that they could remove their followees.

Regarding your proposed solution...

I'm not sure I understand how it would work.
Neuron A adds neuron B as a hotkey and follows it on the ManageNeuron topic, but then neuron B would have to submit a proposal to disburse maturity to an address of neuron B's choosing?
If so, that seems very hacky and also open to attack since a neuron could take all of your maturity rather than the small amount which you had expected them to take.

Yes this is how it has been working for us. We've been using this for donations for the last year.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to set up with the topic missing from the NNS.

You would not do this with a neuron where you didn't want Neuron B taking 100% of your maturity. If you want to limit how much they have access to, you can split your neuron into the percentage you want and dedicate that smaller neuron instead.

I'm not sure it is that hacky...I would imagine this is how DFINITY is managing its neurons except that it likely has three + followers on Manage Neuron to provide multi-sig and is likely issuing merge maturity proposals to merge or spawns if it needs to span maturity.  It seems to be the intended purpose to give others limited control over your neuron via the manage neuron proposal type.
