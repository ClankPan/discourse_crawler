Project overview

Daosky is a decentralized application (dapp) designed to simplify the creation and management of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). The platform enables users to easily create, manage, and participate in DAOs, providing governance tools, treasury management, and proposal execution, all within a user-friendly interface. Daosky is aimed at individuals, organizations, and communities looking to take advantage of the power of blockchain technology for transparent and efficient governance. By addressing the complexities of DAO management, Daosky makes it possible for users to focus on decision-making and collaboration, without the need for extensive technical knowledge.

Web3 Advantages

Daosky leverages the decentralized nature of Web3 to offer a governance solution that is transparent, secure, and resistant to censorship. Unlike Web2 platforms that rely on centralized servers and intermediaries, Daosky operates entirely on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, ensuring that all actions within a DAO are recorded and are verifiable by any participant. This decentralized approach eliminates the risk of single points of failure, offers greater user control, and provides a level of trust that is difficult to achieve with traditional Web2 systems.

How It’s Built

Daosky is built using the Motoko programming language, which is native to the Internet Computer. The backend canisters, including the DAO and token canisters, are designed to handle governance mechanisms, membership management, and treasury operations. These canisters store DAOs in a StableBTreeMap, ensuring efficient and secure data handling. The frontend is developed with React.js, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface that integrates seamlessly with Internet Identity for secure authentication. The system architecture emphasizes modularity, enabling easy updates and scalability as the platform grows.

Internet Computer Superpowers

The Internet Computer's unique features, such as on-chain hosting, native support for decentralized identities (via Internet Identity), and seamless scaling, have been integral to daosky’s development. On-chain hosting eliminates the need for traditional server infrastructure, reducing costs and improving security. The use of Internet Identity allows for a frictionless and secure user experience, ensuring that users can easily authenticate and interact with DAOs. These capabilities, along with the Internet Computer’s ability to process transactions quickly and at scale, make DAOsky more efficient and reliable than it would be on other blockchains or Web2 platforms.

Go-To-Market Strategy

Our go-to-market strategy focuses on engaging with the Web3 community, including DAO enthusiasts, blockchain developers, and decentralized finance (DeFi) practitioners. We plan to collaborate with influential DAOs and Web3 organizations to showcase DAOsky's capabilities. Additionally, we will participate in blockchain conferences, publish technical articles, and offer workshops to educate potential users on how to leverage daosky for their governance needs. Our aim is to build a strong community around Daosky, driving adoption through word-of-mouth and community-driven initiatives.

Monetization

Daosky is designed with a long-term vision of decentralization and community ownership. While the platform is free to use, we are exploring various monetization strategies, including premium features for advanced governance tools, transaction fees for specific DAO actions, and partnerships with other blockchain projects. The eventual goal is to launch a Service Nervous System (SNS) to decentralize the governance of Daosky, allowing the community to shape the platform's future while creating a sustainable revenue model.

Status of the Project

We are currently on the development of the MVP for DAOsky, including the frontend and backend components. The platform's core functionalities, such as DAO creation, proposal management, and tokenomics, have been implemented and thoroughly tested. Integration with Internet Identity for user authentication is also complete. We are currently in the testing phase, refining the user experience and ensuring that all components work seamlessly together. We will soon open the platform for beta testing to gather user feedback and make final adjustments before the official launch.

Future Plans

Looking ahead, we plan to introduce additional features such as advanced analytics for DAO performance, multi-chain support, and enhanced security measures, including zero-knowledge proofs. We are also exploring opportunities to integrate with other blockchain ecosystems, expanding the reach and utility of Daosky. Additionally, we aim to participate in upcoming blockchain conferences to present Daosky and establish partnerships that will drive further adoption. Our long-term vision includes applying for additional grants to continue developing the platform and eventually launching an SNS to transition Daosky into a fully decentralized and community-governed project.

Hi @yinks002, I'd encourage you to take a look at https://github.com/icdevsorg/axon. The front end is a bit of a mess, but the back end already has a ton of DAO features built into it. It needs a bit of updating to make the tokens it produces for each DAO ICRC1/2/3/4 compliant, but that should be a fairly straightforward upgrade task since the components already exist.

It is open source an just sitting there for someone to use. I hope it is helpful.
