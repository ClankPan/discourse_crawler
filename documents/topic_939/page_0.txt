Hello community,

The Tungsten release of the SDK - `V0.6.0` - is now available for download!

As many of you know, this is our first public release in a while, and with good reason - this is a BIG and exciting one :tada:

For a summary of all of the features and fixes, check out the release notes [here](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/release-notes/sdk-release-notes.html). We have made major accompanying updates to the docs as well and will continue to update in the coming days.

Happy coding!
