So maybe Im thinking about this in the wrong way, but originally i developed my application website with the expectation to access the CANDID UI once it was deployed to the IC, to sort of ADMIN the website in realtime (make changes to data in backend and update things with the UI), however this is not possible? i assigned the CANDID UI to a canister and loaded it up with cycles, is that unnecessary? since you cannot access it anymore once it is on the IC.
Thanks for any clarification, Im new to these concepts:)

You can access Candid UI on the IC with this url: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/

You can make calls to the canister, but it doesn't give you "admin" access, because it's using the anonymous identity.

Thank you for that, and to be clear theres no need to assign my CANDID UI to a unique canister when i deploy?

No. Candid UI is a generic canister that works for all canisters.

I'm trying to get the Candid interface of the cycles minting canister using Candid UI, navigating to this URL: https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/?id=rkp4c-7iaaa-aaaaa-aaaca-cai. But am getting the following error displayed on-screen:

An error happened in Candid canister:
Error: Cannot fetch candid file
    at Object.fetchActor (https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/index.js:2:264124)
    at async https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/index.js:2:272354

The same error appears for all other canisters I've tried.

I wonder what I may be doing wrong?

For Rust canisters, you will have to provide the did file for now. https://a4gq6-oaaaa-aaaab-qaa4q-cai.raw.ic0.app/ allows you to upload the did file associated with the canister id.

Eventually, all canisters will embed the did file as part of the Wasm module. But this takes time to implement.

That mean if install wasm module using ic-install_code interface, it will cause many problems with type.
Is't implement yet?

I think `dfx build` already embeds the did file in the Wasm module, so you don't have to manually provide the did file.

You could do this icscan.io since it lets you authenticate.

When viewing a canister, pressing “Call” or “Query with Wallet” shows this:

You’d need to find your principal on icscan.io after authenticating and then add that to your canister as a controller.
