Hi, I am building an app that involves doing file processing in a canister and I need to read files one byte at a time(and do multiple operations on these bytes) which 99.99% of the time gets me into an `instruction limit for single message execution` error, I tried improving my algorithms and data structures several times but at this point I don't think I can do anything more in that direction. 

My instinct says that I should be moving all my file processing logic in an off-chain python/java micro service but I decided that before pivoting I should be asking the community as well. What do you guys think? Is it feasible to do file processing in canisters or should I definitely move off-chain?

Thank you!
