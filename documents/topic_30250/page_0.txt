The [CycleOps](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/meet-cycleops-proactive-automated-no-code-canister-management-for-the-internet-computer/20969) team has provided a few tutorials on how to:
* [Migrate Cycles from the Cycles Wallet to the new Dfinity Cycles Ledger](https://www.notion.so/cycleops/Using-The-Cycles-Ledger-with-CycleOps-b5d19c2afc784046acf16ab01a1fc2c7?pvs=4#74fe6c7ab41d43728a050cc25d041300)
* [Migrate Cycles from XTC to the new Dfinity Cycles Ledger](https://www.notion.so/cycleops/Using-The-Cycles-Ledger-with-CycleOps-b5d19c2afc784046acf16ab01a1fc2c7?pvs=4#d074814a509640fea018dc071509450e)

as part of our new CycleOps feature allowing developers to [bring their own cycles for canister monitoring and automated cycles top ups](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bring-your-own-cycles-for-automated-canister-topups-via-the-new-cycles-ledger/29705) on CycleOps.
