Quickly click through, filter, group and review upcoming proposals by topic, status, proposer etc., see which proposals require most attention and further review and where best to focus your time.

- Immediately see which proposals are still accepting votes.

- Focus on groups of related proposals together.

- Easily identify and filter proposals from the same proposer.

- Queue proposals for voting.

- üß† Save brain time.

Wow, I like this a lot.
Would be nice to see where the vote stand (YES and NO) for proposals still in voting process.
Still, really good tool.
Thank you

Recent updates‚Ä¶

* üëç You can now input your Neuron ID to keep track of the proposals you‚Äôve not yet voted on.

* Filter by Proposer directly from any proposal you‚Äôre reading to check for other proposals they might have made.

* Change selection mode to ‚Äòswitch‚Äô in the Filters to work through topics one at a time.

Also

* New topics‚Äîkeep up with Subnet and Replica version management, and SNS launch proposals.

* If you‚Äôre only interested in the execution of proposals you can group the inbox differently, by Open proposals.

There are a few other things hiding away in there too ; ) and more to come.

Love this app. Is it possible to add in SNS support so one can toggle at the top?
