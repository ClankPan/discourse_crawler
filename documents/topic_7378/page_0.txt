What happens if for some reason $HOME/.config..../identity.pem gets deleted or corrupted? Is it possible to re-generate the same principal, or would you have permanently lost access to any canisters (and cycles) for which the lost principal was the controller?

You would lose access, it's recommended to backup your `identity.pem`.
