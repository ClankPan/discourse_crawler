Many times in the stories of technology startups you read, there is a repeated story that they improved one small thing and suddenly sales took off, because previously people would simply leave after a few seconds.

I personally think that many URLs for Internet Identity could be something like this.
Some apps using https://identity.internetcomputer.org
Some https://identity.ic0.app

People after registering on one address do not understand why the other one does not work, and attempts to export/switch are forcing them to make an effort that they do not want to make according to UX laws.

So is it possible to remove one of them?
