Hash.hash is deprecated on Nat type. So I decided to make bespoke hash function

Which one should I use? Red, Green or Blue? or None of them? and why?

Also, am i understanding this correctly? That since I want to hash Nat64 to Hash (nat32), there will be a "bucket" with the same "hashcode" that contains multiple data entries?
