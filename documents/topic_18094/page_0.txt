# My Intent

Ahoy ICP devs! 

Within the internal DFINITY team channels (OpenChat, Signal, Slack), I have seen some developer-centric technical questions which I think would be great for the wider developer forum to see. I think they can be helpful to share the question/answer so future folks looking for answers can find them.

This is my first attempt at doing this, and if people do not find it useful, I will stop :) 

Let me know what you think. Thanks!


# Question 
*How can I get a json file hosted on the IC with JS in the browser?*


*`fetch` isn’t working because I get CORS issues. Can they be set in the canister? Or should I use agent-js somehow? I believe it’s a normal CORS issue, but with IC maybe I’m missing something :sweat_smile:*

*Thanks!*

## Answer
*you can configure the asset canister to return custom headers, i.e., you can configure*

> *Access-Control-Allow-Origin: **

*there and you should be able to fetch it from a different origin.*

Configure it where? I didn't know there was a config file for the standard Asset canister.

[`.ic-assets.json`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/updates/release-notes/#new-feature-support-for-configuring-assets-in-assets-canister)

Ideally everyone asks all technical questions in the open forum, so that their answers are also searchable and in the open forum.

Anonymous posting can probably be enabled if necessary.

I agree. 

I do think its reasonable people post things in internal channels because they expect faster reply, but I think moving more and more openly is good.

To be honest, I anonymized the question for non-obvious reason:

1. I removed information about the problem that I thought the original author may not want in a public format.

2. I anomymized also because I see a whole lot of internal slack questions which i think would help to be public, and anomyzing would make it easier to get the blessing to post it. I want to do LOTS more.
