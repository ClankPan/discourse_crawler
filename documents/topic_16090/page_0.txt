# The NNS Needs Direction
The NNS is both the greatest strength and the most likely point of failure for the Internet Computer. Everything depends on getting it right.

Right now we are starting to mature as an ecosystem, so big questions such as creating an NNS Treasury are being debated. The problem is that we all have different views regarding what the NNS is, should be, and could be. We are debating something which currently has no unified purpose, ethos, or constitution. This means the validity of different arguments regarding the NNS are fairly arbitrary, subjective, and often based on individual preferences.

This situation is far from ideal. We should first work to define the driving ethos of the NNS, and from that, we can then navigate a clear path forward for its future.

There is precedent for this, the [Ethereum Foundation makes its philosophy clear on its website](https://ethereum.foundation/philosophy). In short, we need something like this for the NNS, to unify the community around a set of shared principles regarding its purpose, usage, and future.

## This Proposal & The Process For Ratification

This proposal is simply a vote on whether or not we should begin the process of ratifying an ethos for the NNS. After it's accepted, each individual Guiding Principle making up the ethos document will be its own proposal. Over the course of a few months, the ethos will collect Guiding Principals until there's a final proposal to ratify the ethos as "basically complete". 

---
>**EDIT 10/24**
Actually, I think a time limit would be the best way to handle this, since it'll never be "100% complete". Basically, we'd start the process of creating the Ethos once this proposal gets approved, and from that point "Guiding Principles" can be added via proposals. At the end of December 2022, we can consider the Ethos complete enough for publication and general distribution/usage. 

---

From that point, it'll remain a living document that can be modified via proposals, but we can all move forward using its contents as the foundation for evaluating proposals. Once ratified the ethos should also be added to the DFINITY documentation, NNS App, and other front ends. This will let new users being onboarded into the ecosystem have confidence regarding how the NNS will be used.

>EDIT 10/24
>
>## Is this a list of rules? How would it be enforced?
>It’s not about making rules, it’s about clarifying the current consensus regarding the usage of the NNS. That’s all.
>
>If the NNS had an ethos which directed it toward being a steward of the protocol, then it could still someday transform into something like a global digital government. I’m not saying we even could put rules in place to prevent that from happening.
>
>The difference is that a transformation of the NNS can happen deceptively and slowly, and without an ethos that shift would go fairly unnoticed. If there’s an ethos in place, then shifts in the focus of the NNS would involve updating the Ethos during the process, and that’ll give community members like myself a clear indication if I’m starting to contribute to something I never wanted to be a part of.
>
>As is a stands with the NNS right now, do any of us have any clear idea of exactly what the NNS is going to do with it's control of the network? What exactly are we contributing to? I think it’s worth taking some time to try and define that.
>
>## Why "Ethos"? What will this provide?
>Perhaps “Ethos” is the wrong word. If you know of a better one, please suggest it!
>
>We need a way to set accurate general expectations for what the NNS will do with it’s power, so that token holders and projects can make long term decisions. Why would you build on a network where the NNS has the power to censor your canister, and you have literally nothing to go off of which could give you a clear indication of what might bring that situation about? How can you trust a token when more could be minted at any time, and there’s not even a general idea of how and why that might happen?
>
>The Ethos can change too, and if it changes to misalign with the needs of specific stakeholders, then those stakeholders need to know so that they can leave to join other web3 networks which do fit their needs. For example, if the community did want an NNS that could act as a central bank, then many projects would leave. Right now some are leaving simply due to the lack of certainty, which is a pity because I don’t think the NNS Treasury thing will ever actually be implemented. If there was an Ethos opposing things like the NNS becoming a central bank, perhaps these projects would have less uncertainty in the future of the NNS and be willing to stay.
>
>If the Ethos is largely ignored and problems arise, that can be called to attention to drive the promotion of either changes made to it (to generalize it further) or have more adherence to it. It’ll just be a tool for helping drive general alignment, which won’t be perfect but it can at least be an improvement on the current situation.

## Possible Guiding Principles
I'd like to submit these as examples of Guiding Principles that we might consider adding to the NNS Ethos, should this proposal pass and we begin the process. However, as stated each guiding principle should be its own proposal and be collaboratively composed by the community.

- ### 1. The exclusive goal of the NNS is to be the steward of the Internet Computer Protocol
The NNS exists specifically to maintain the ICP network in a fair and decentralized manner. Despite what it can or could do, no other purpose or task should be applied beyond its responsibility of making sure the network is reliable, robust, and secure for all those who use it or build upon it. Users and developers need to know that the NNS will not take on other agendas beyond fulfilling the promise of a fair and decentralized world computer and that it will never become their competitor, enemy, or ally.

Other types of goals and tasks beyond this scope can be fulfilled by dapps built on top of the Internet Computer, and the NNS's only job is making sure the network remains the perfect foundation for that to happen.

In other words, if the NNS starts doing anything which might make it a competitor to something which could be built on top of it, then its starting to exceed it's scope of responsibilities. The NNS is the only entity that can maintain the ICP network, so that should remain its exclusive focus and responsibility.

- ### 2. The NNS is inclusive, impartial, agnostic, and resistant to collusion.
NNS deliberation should be based on the merit and logic of proposals, and place no limitations or preferences for who can participate based on how much money, power, and/or influence a proposer does or doesn't have. In other words, the NNS is a tool used, owned, and available to every neuron holder without restriction, prejudice, or bias.

Since collusion and majority control by a small group would break the accessibility and impartiality of the NNS, the NNS may adopt measures that contribute to reducing the risk, impact, and incentives of collusion.

- ### 3. Politics, Morality, and Philosophy are outside the scope of the NNS.
The NNS must never become a political platform or tool for evaluating ethics. The NNS has no place in deciding what "the greater good" is in a situation that's not directly related to the technical operation of the network. The NNS has no right to violate any human rights of any group or individual in any situation. The NNS should not be used to determine what organizations, projects, or people are "worth", "owed", or "for".

The NNS stands for nothing except making sure the ICP Network remains strong and stable.

In the rare and unlikely situation that the NNS finds itself as the exclusive and necessary decider in something outside its scope (perhaps akin to the [Trolly problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)), it should delegate the dilemma to individual neuron holders, not allowing an outcome via a proposal. This is because proposals represent the official stance of the protocol, and the protocol should not take a stance on these types of issues. 

In other words, in situations where it cannot be avoided, then neuron holders may be given a mechanism to individually evaluate the morality/politics of a situation, but the NNS shouldn't take a stance or determine the outcome uniformly by using the proposal mechanism.

- ### 4. The NNS will not risk the long-term stability of the network to address immediate problems.
Startups often need to follow advice such as "move fast and break things". However, the NNS is not a startup, it maintains the foundation for an entire ecosystem of builders which need long-term reliability for their dapps to succeed. As such, the NNS cannot afford to "break things", and must not let important matters with long-term effects be rushed by the impatience or urgency which will always be present. The NNS will be controlling a network that will exist beyond any of us, a network that may come to have powers beyond anything we currently realize, so we cannot know what sacrifices we would be making when putting the long-term stability of the protocol at risk.

- ### 5. The NNS will protect & respect user autonomy, privacy, and participation
The NNS will not become a tyrant by controlling users and/or assets as a police force or justice institution. ICP was invented specifically to create a safe place for autonomy, privacy, and participation, so the NNS must respect, reinforce, and adhere to those goals.

- ### 6. The NNS will safeguard tokenomic trust & security through non-interference
Manipulated economic systems are inherently unjust and untrustworthy. Users need to trust that, even over the long term, the tokenomics of ICP will not be manipulated via the NNS to promote the agendas of different community participants.

- ### 7. The NNS will only censor to avoid the distribution and proliferation of gross physical human suffering or to protect the operational functionality of the network.
The NNS may choose to censor when something violates a law that is both common across most countries and known as an obvious wrongdoing that causes gross physical human suffering. This means child pornography websites, murder-for-hire marketplaces, human trafficking websites, and illegal military weapon dealing marketplaces are all eligible for censorship.

However, the NNS does not define or determine justice, it simply provides neuron holders with a mechanism for flushing out extreme examples of content that directly stem from or facilitate the physical harm of innocent people against their will.

For example, something may be illegal simply because it doesn't fit the political agenda or propaganda of a particular government, but that doesn't mean it should be censored. Likewise, a project may do something morally wrong, but it does not cause any physical harm and the NNS has no right to censor it (such as a website that let's married people find someone to cheat on their spouse with). Other crimes involving willing participants, sensitive data, and/or intangible harm (such as emotional) are not the NNS's responsibility or obligation to censor.

Again, the NNS should not be the police, small claims court, or judge of the network, it's censorship power is a tool of last resort to only be used against atrocities.

Regarding the aspect of "or to protect the functionality of the network". This is meant to protect the NNS's ability to remove any canisters with harmful code that threatens the functional integrity of the network/protocol. This is because the NNS's primary task is keeping the network stable.

Thanks for starting this discussion @aiv we clearly needs it.

I would add that the NNS should aims to become as decentralised and accessible as possible. 
There should never be any barrier built in the system to participate (expect the cost of $ICP & an Internet connection).  In the future, there might be special types of neurons (named, KYC?, certified?) but those new features should never suppress the possibility of having a totally anonymous & basic neuron participating in the governance process.

[/quote]

In order to achieve this, involving politics is unavoidable
Only by becoming a government can have real management power, otherwise the so-called voting weight will look pale in front of the traditional authority

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-23 00:51:02 UTC | #6

“Politics” regarding the technical aspects of subnet management, and politics regarding controlling and policing participants of the community are vastly different things.

There needs to be scope for the power of the NNS.

In any regard, the individual guiding principles are up for debate, but this proposal is about starting the process to begin defining them in the first place, by kicking off an ethos ratification effort.

For example, if the NNS is to simply be a protocol steward, then it should be handled vastly different than if it’s to become a governing global power (like a digital country). Until we all decide what it’s purpose is, we’re all going to just waste time pulling it in different directions with no unified vision or purpose. In that case, it’ll become nothing but a mis-managed mess.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-10-23 01:04:26 UTC | #7

This is a great conversation. 

I wonder... to vote competently on all proposals requires knowledge of many disciplines. It is highly unusual for one person to possess multi-disciplinary knowledge. 

There are 11 Governance Domains, currently one can "follow" others for ALL Domains. 

What if this were to change, ie one can "follow" neurons for up to 8 topics, leaving 3 that have to be voted on manually IF one wanted to earn the full staking return. 

It would seem reasonable to suggest people would choose to vote manually on topics they have some knowledge of, or which they are interested to learn more about. 

Perhaps also, one cannot follow the same neuron for more than 4 Domains. This would encourage Named Neurons to declare an interest in particular Domains and prevent a small number of neurons from dominating/influencing all 11 Governance Domains. 

I appreciate this is a deviation from the idea of establishing an Ethos through agreeing Principles. I hope it stimulates thought on how a positive and practical Principled Ethos can be encouraged by using the system as it is.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-23 01:10:20 UTC | #8

I think governance subtopics for more granular following would be cool, but I don't see how that would remove the need for an Ethos which defines and scope the power of the NNS.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-10-23 01:15:20 UTC | #9

Ah, I wasn't suggesting this would remove the need for an ethos. But it would support the practical application of an ethos. Without such a mechanism, one would never know if people were applying the ethos, or simply paying lip-service to it in public and doing something completely different in practice.  

An ethos cannot be enforced, but that doesn't mean it cannot be encouraged :)

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-23 01:21:20 UTC | #10

Ah, yeah I get you!

The Ethos cannot be enforced, but it would be a clear indicator of which neurons do and do not adhere to the best interests of the NNS. It'll be a useful framework for evaluating proposals and neurons for following, and a foundation for arguments to be rooted on the agreed upon scope of the NNS.

Basically, if a known neuron refuses to follow the Ethos, and cannot get approval to change the Ethos to fit how it wants to guide the NNS, then it's misaligned and that'll be easily made obvious to everyone.

-------------------------

NickM | 2022-10-23 01:27:51 UTC | #11

You have stated a good conversation and I look forward to it developing.

I'll add more if appropriate :slight_smile:

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-10-23 03:02:13 UTC | #12

I love this as core basic ethos of the NNS. I fully support having some guiding principles. If they could enforced by codes that would be even better. For example, anything that requires change to the tokenomics or censorship of a canister should require a threshold of votes to adopt.

This point is itself political and very questionable because, at the very least, all economic systems are manipulated. So much debate about inflation is based on a misunderstanding of the economics of nations and the misapplication of that misunderstanding to the cryptosphere which does not operate the way nations do.
Rather than remove politics from the NNS, this approach would freeze it in a shape reflecting a specific political viewpoint.

The US dollar is the world’s reserve currency. It’s solid and getting stronger, right? But did you know that for the world and the global economy, that’s not too good if kept unresolved. 

Hypothetically, let’s say we are in 2025….and

The IC is the world’s leading blockchain technology. It’s solid and getting stronger right? But did you know that if the current inflation mechanisms can not be solved then the global blockchain economy would be in a bad condition. (Inflation)

Hear me out…

First, have you heard of the phrase the “DOLLAR DOOM LOOP!”

Let me explain the impact this has in the world and then by comparison the same would happen to ICP if inflation in not safely contained.

Since 1944, when 44 countries voted to create the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and World Bank, the US dollar has been known as the world’s reserve currency. This agreement is known as the [Bretton Woods Agreement](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/bretton-woods-agreement/) and officially made the US dollar the most trusted currency and allowed the US to export its debt much more effortlessly.

In 1971, President Nixon ‘temporarily suspended’ the convertibility of US dollars into gold, completely separating the dollar from gold and voiding the [gold standard](https://arrestyourdebt.com/why-is-gold-valuable/) completely. This means that every time the US government prints money to pay its debt, it’s like writing an ‘IOU’ on paper. There’s no guarantee that the [government will ever have the money to pay](https://wealthofgeeks.com/free-money-from-the-government/) that IOU back.

Follow me here…

I’m looking through the lens of the future, and here is how I think uncontrollable inflation would negatively impact the community.

As of today, national debt in the US has surpassed &31 Trillion. To my eyes, we’ve entered a new ‘dollar doom loop’ cycle. Forcing the US dollar to be strong, makes foreign countries sink further into economic troubles. In other terms, it takes more of their specified currency to make one US dollar. Zimbabwe a country in Africa, is suffering from such incredibly high inflation, topping a significant 200%, that their [central bank has started printing gold coins](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/26/zimbabwe-launches-gold-coins-to-stem-inflation) for public purchase to try and steer clear of the US dollar.

This can directly be reflected in the IC ecosystem. Say the price of ICP is suffering from inflation, how can projects pegged on ICP change?

Fixing inflation can be solved in two ways. The first is for the Fed to cut interest rates to a level that allows for more purchasing power for the US dollar, causing foreign countries to regain some of their local currency’s value.

In the ICP this can be seen as letting neurons dissolve

The second option is for growth outside the US to recover. However, with inflation sweeping the globe, this isn’t likely to happen, considering the US is sitting pretty to weather this inflationary period, and we’re still seeing record inflation numbers.

The third option is for China to stimulate its economy. This option has worked in the past to break a doom loop cycle and could hypothetically work again.

In the ICP it may be time to approach the African market and sell your products 🇰🇪 This would stimulate growth but no one is willing to have that conversation at the current time. And you can not avoid politics because politics creates law with created order that is needed for business to be in check. Just my thoughts.

mechaquan | 2022-10-23 07:24:34 UTC | #15

Thanks for writing this up!  This is a great summary…

My specific question is around how we enforce this “constitution” without hard systemic controls?!

We can pass all the motions we want and that won’t stop any future attempts to expand the scope.

We need to think about if we want to implement systemic controls and what they could look like.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-23 10:58:29 UTC | #16

Well it's premature to discuss enforcement before the Ethos even exists and is defined.

Some aspects (such as locking certain tokenomic functions) may be enforceable in code, but others may not be.

The point of the Ethos is for being a non-subjective foundation from which we can all evaluate proposals and known neurons, from which we can judge their alignment to the scope of the NNS. 

If someone pushes an agenda that violates the defined Ethos, then unless they can first change the Ethos to fit their agenda they are objectively wrong.

In other words, coming to consensus over an Ethos would itself be useful, even if all of the guiding principles of the Ethos cannot be strictly enforced via code right from the start.

An example would be the unofficial "allow time for deliberation on the dev forum before publishing a proposal" community expectation.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-23 11:03:59 UTC | #17

Well the individual guiding principles are still up for debate, this proposal is more about starting the process of defining them to ratify an Ethos.

Even if you don't think we should freeze the tokenomics, then we should still define the scope for tokenomic policy.

Even if some types of politics will remain relevant to the NNS, it's probably wise to not include every form of politics. There's a big difference between the politics of tweaking a neuron reward parameter and defining a new human right.

While I agree with this statement, I think it comes from a sense that there is a dire problem based on misconceptions about how the NNS works.  For some reason, people think the NNS is a platform for expression of free speech and they are willing to propose whatever they want without deliberation.  That gets people riled up thinking the NNS is fragile and can change willy nilly.  This is simply not true.  There are no governance motion proposals that will ever implement code changes.  Most voting power that is cast on the Governance topic is able to recognize which proposals are worthy of passing and even if something is passed it doesn't mean it will get implemented.  All implementation today occurs by DFINITY, including development of the technical solution, security reviews, as well as merging the code.  No matter how good an idea and how much NNS support exists, it won't get implemented unless DFINTIY puts it on their roadmap and makes it happen.  When it comes to tokenomics, there is no change that has ever occurred that was not originated by DFINITY and implemented by DFINITY in an effort to address real decentralization problems.  They were all implemented consistent with the NNS governance and tokenomics design and none of them were willy nilly changes.  Yes, there were side effects, but those side effects are tolerable relative to the problems they solved.  I think our memories are short as a community.  We forget how far we have come since genesis when it comes to decentralization and it is solely because of efforts that have been made by DFINITY to push the community in the direction of decentralization on the Governance topic.

To be honest, the NNS exists so a large body of people can make decisions based on what they think will individually benefit them financially the most so that, in aggregate, the decisions that are made are in the long term best interest of the IC.  Even if there were a community supported ethos, there will be people who disagree and will do their own thing.  The only way to prevent it is to gate keep in some way, which is counter to the proposed ethos.

In addition to the enforcement problem with having an ethos, I think it may be important to consider whether this ethos is intended for the community or for DFINITY.  The precedent cited is the Ethereum Foundation, which implies this ethos is really intended for DFINITY Foundation.  DFINITY Foundation is not the NNS and as decentralization occurs over time this will become more apparent to the community.  However, the reality is that today only DFINITY controls the NNS with the one exception of the Governance topic, which is partially decentralized and has no effect on the internet computer except for community perception of decentralization.  So there is perception that the community has power, but in reality it does not have power today.  Hence, it almost seems like there is no point in creating an ethos for the community and I don't think it is appropriate for the community to try to create an ethos for DFINITY.

Those are my initial thoughts, but to be honest I don't know the right answer.  It seems this idea should be considered under the umbrella of the Governance working group.  I suggest pursuing it in that way.

-------------------------

vavram | 2022-10-23 19:34:13 UTC | #19

Your ideas are clearly well intended but personally I think it's a bit too early in Internet Computer's development to be talking about ratifying stuff, in my humble opinion this needs to be delayed until the NNS becomes reasonably decentralized which is clearly not the case at the moment.

Just my 2c

-------------------------

paulyoung | 2022-10-23 21:53:42 UTC | #20

After some consideration, I think it makes sense for individual neurons to have guiding principles behind how they vote but I’m undecided on having something that applies to the NNS itself.

[/quote]

The NNS is both fragile and powerful, and to pretend anything different is misguided.

Sure, up until now most proposals have been harmless motion proposals, but the NNS controls the ICP tokenomics, the subnets, the fate of node providers, and the fate of dapps. You and David have been leading talks about trying to use it's tokenomic power to "create more DFINITY's", what is that if not power?

It's also fragile specifically because DFINITY currently controls all of the actual state-changing proposal types. The community needs to take control of this over time and decentralize the role of DFINITY, and this will be an inherently difficult process with lots of potential pitfalls. If we fail to fully decentralize the NNS, and DFINITY maintains complete control over the long term, then we fail to actually become a web3 network. If this isn't a fragile situation I don't know what is.

[/quote]

Politicians are free to oppose the constitution of their country, and sadly sometimes they are even successful. A stated Ethos/constitution isn't about about gate keeping, it's about providing a common ground for determining alignment with the stated parameters of a governance power.

For example, if the Ethos states that the NNS is to be focused on stewardship of the protocol, but a known neuron tries to push it into becoming a digital government, then "doing it's own thing" is clearly against the Ethos and it's opposition can draw attention to that fact to drive support for voting down their proposals. If there is no Ethos, it's just a bunch of people with completely different visions for the NNS throwing their opinions back and forth, not coming to consensus on any defined path forward and having no external shared reference they could use for drawing the community into alignment.

The example was from Ethereum foundation, but it was just an example. The Ethos would be for defining the purpose and scope of the NNS, so it's not intended for the community or DFINITY.

However, to your point, if we define an Ethos and DFINITY violates it, then we can call foul, demand they make things right, and use the situation to continue work towards replacing their role. We don't need to define an Ethos for DFINITY as an organization, but we do have the right as neuron holders to demand they act according to our guidelines when using the influence we delegate to them.

aiv | 2022-10-24 01:19:11 UTC | #22

If it's too soon to discuss ratifying any purpose or scope for the NNS, then it's CERTAINLY too early to start discussing how we might create an NNS Treasury to give it the powers of a central bank. Unfortunately, that discussion has already started.

My fear is that, without any guiding principles in place, the NNS will entrench power and not become more decentralized.

Neurons and Named Neurons can certainly have their own scope and goals, but the NNS could still use an Ethos.

Compare this situation to the USA government and the two political parties. Each party has it's own agenda, values, and goals, but the constitution is a tool for drawing attention to situations where a party might diverge too far away from the common shared vision of the nation. It's a tool for driving generalized alignment between many different and even opposing parties with their own individual interests.

Without an Ethos, no one really has anything more than an subjective opinion as to why their direction for the NNS is best. There's no shared foundation or expectation the community can use to know or judge what the NNS should be used for.

I absolutely agree the NNS needs an ethos/constitution/however you wanna call it, it will instill more trust in both stakers and devs, for the latter especially it is quite unnerving to know your dApp could be taken off the network by liquid democracy, at very least there should be guidelines known beforehand to assure what kind of content the NNS is willing to keep on the IC.

I have 2 concerns tho: 
1) How do we make sure the ethos is actually followed.

2) Point 7 states " The NNS will only censor to protect the operational functionality of the network.", it is then specified that clause applies to canister running harmful code, in my opinion it could also be applied to legit canister whose dubious legality or sensitive content, e.g Wikileaks 2.0, causes the node operators running them to shut down in order to comply with legal requests.
I know Dfinity has proposed to use boundary nodes as censors, but I don't think it will be enough if the IC were ever to be under public scrutiny. What would the NNS do then? Protect the network integrity and remove the canister, throwing the dev under the bus and essentially renouncing on any censorship resistance claims or penalize the providers who have invested thousands on dollars on node hardware?

It’s also fragile specifically because DFINITY currently controls all of the actual state-changing proposal types. The community needs to take control of this over time and decentralize the role of DFINITY, and this will be an inherently difficult process with lots of potential pitfalls. If we fail to fully decentralize the NNS, and DFINITY maintains complete control over the long term, then we fail to actually become a web3 network. If this isn’t a fragile situation I don’t know what is.

OMG you are making my point for me.  You are calling it fragile and I am calling it not decentralized.  Yet you are standing it the way of the only viable path forward in which it actually becomes less fragile and less centralized.  It’s a long road ahead to achieve decentralization and the only way that will happen is when people and organizations are able to step forward and become contributors to the IC.  We can’t sprinkle some magic fairy dust and hope that people will volunteer or make donations to make it happen.  We are talking real careers and organizations that can only exist with funding.  An ethos as you have defined it won’t solve the decentralization problem.  The NNS is not fragile.  It is controlled by the very people who should be controlling it at this time and they have provided ample evidence that their intent is decentralization over time as the community becomes capable of handling that responsibility.

**EDIT 10/27**
I didn't want to change by original post to be transparent and preserve the factual history of the conversation, but I want to be clear here that it was not my intention to imply anything negative regarding anyone's character. While we may disagree on ideas, I think Wenzel and David want nothing but the best for the ecosystem. https://twitter.com/IsaacValadez55/status/1585631550711812102?s=20&t=RVIp_CTK4VCIMLDC_fCuNg

---

I literally sat in a private in-person meeting last Thursday where you & David argued the case for using the NNS to fund a single "DFINITY-like" organization, and every safeguard I brought up was shot down due to a base-less desire for urgency at all costs. That is centralization. Synapse still has 10% voting power, that's centralization.

"Funding" comes from building value. We don't need speculators and volunteers running governance, we need value-creating projects running it to protect the foundation of their own infrastructure. 

This call for an Ethos isn't "fairy dust". My guess is that you are only saying that because it would slow down and likely end up opposing your clear ambition for promoting the creation of a NNS Treasury. I'll be upfront, that is my goal, because an Ethos is needed specifically needed to protect builders from things like that. Without it, builders will look up after several months of building and realize the network changed around them, instead of simply providing the protocol stability they needed.

The hard push for an NNS Treasury is not for the good of the community, because it's been pushed despite the active harm its caused to the community. We have builders and good people losing faith in the strength of the token and future of the NNS, and I personally know of at least 3 builders who are leaving the Internet Computer because they believe the existing powers controlling the network are entrenching themselves. Yes we need funding, but we shouldn't harm the ecosystem by how we push to get it.

You're free to think it's a bad idea, but I disagree and will continue.

The NNS governance working group is free to become involved (and I will make an effort to attend their future meetings), but they don't have the monopoly on working on governance topics. The NNS is an open DAO, and I'm using the approach which was common before working groups even existed.

Also, I'm not doing this alone. In fact, it looks like I have significant support for this proposal.

How do we make sure the ethos is actually followed.
[/quote]

By "social contract" basically. For example, if someone doesn't post a proposal on this dev forum for ~7 days prior to submitting it for live voting on the NNS, then a lot of neurons will vote it down simply because there was not enough time for deliberation.

Likewise, if someone makes a proposal against the Ethos, then those who agreed with the Ethos will vote it down.

Perhaps some aspects could be enforced by code (such as locking tokenomics), but in general it's not meant to be a strict code of law, simply a set of "guiding principles" for aligning the community and giving them a shared foundation of unity.

So this proposal is only for getting the Ethos process started, I just included some guiding principles to serve as examples.

For point 7, I specifically tried to make it clear that "sensitive data" or "anything illegal" didn't qualify. I just meant that if a canister was actually breaking the network by stalling a subnet or something (which has happened before) that we could stop it to fix a significant technical problem.

Yeah, not saying that is literally the case, just the vibes around it. That's why we need to have some kind of chat/forum feature directly integrated into the NNS. When a new proposal is made there could be 7 days of deliberation, then transition to the voting phase.

This is an incredible mischaracterization.  It was not an accident that you were present.  You ideas were recognized as highly valuable and desirable.

radudaniel | 2022-10-24 14:11:06 UTC | #38

I think this is a good initiative, and is good that it was put forth for discussion.

In order for the NNS to function properly it requires more structure and comprehensive execution of the motion proposals which in the current state of how the NNS is structured for the governance proposals there is no clear roadmap on how/if they are implemented. 

Lately the NNS has been used for exposing personal perspectives, awareness campaigns - and low quality proposals. If we are to talk about something so relevant, why not set the proper structure from day zero? although I understand the urgency with latest discussions about some subjects, but objectively I see no need to rush this discussion, . 

To define the Ethos of the community most active members should be involved and the document should be a collaborative result.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-24 14:18:48 UTC | #39

Yes, this is exactly what this proposal is, that we start a collaborative effort to define an Ethos.

The guiding principles I included were just examples, but each one added would need to be it's own proposal, collaboratively constructed by the community.

It wasn't my intention to mischaracterize, I tried to be careful with the wording but perhaps I wasn't clear.

I did not get a calendar invite for the discussion and I don't think anyone (including myself) knew I'd be there that early before the planned meetup later in the afternoon, but I'll take your word that it wasn't an accident, that's nice to know!

I didn't say it was a meeting of a single organization, I actually still don't know who called it or how it came to be. I wasn't arguing, commenting, or implying anything about the meeting's attendees or how it came to be, just about that specific discussion point that was brought up during it.

I did feel my ideas were valued, upon reflection "shot down" is probably not the best wording. Specifically, I'm referring to the point where it was said that, "Isaac's goodwill ICP strategy is clearly the safest and best path forward, but we don't have time to wait and it would take too long to put in place, so how can we find a way to get the funds the ecosystem needs in the near term." At that point, I personally felt like an agenda was still being pushed even though it didn't withstand scrutiny. Perhaps I'm misguided in that perception.

Giving a single (or handful) and entities funds from the NNS is centralization, not decentralization, that's what I was calling centralized. 

The two oldest Known Neurons (the second of which follows Synapse) and DFINITY collectively control the outcome of most proposals. I'm not stating that there's any greed or wrongdoing regarding that, just stating that as a known a fact about the current flow and voting power on the NNS right now. 

For the health of the NNS, that needs to change so things can become more decentralized. I suggest an Ethos to provide guardrails as this change happens and NNS control becomes more decentralized.

If people don't like my idea for kicking off the Ethos ratification process, they can vote down my proposal. In the meantime, I'm happy to discuss pros and cons here. Do you have an argument for why an Ethos for the NNS would be a bad thing and should never exist?

I'd like to see the NNS full of Known Neurons that represent either individuals and projects with dapps that are creating value for the network, so I'm not sure if I could properly advocate for that while being part of Synapse...

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-10-24 15:22:01 UTC | #44

@aiv , one of the reasons I believe this proposal is wrongheaded can be found in the very word Ethos. An ethos is a culture, a set of customs, a code that people live by. It is not a set of written down rules. Any rules that are written down are actually governed by the ethos of the culture. To illustrate with a famous example, the first words of the US declaration of independence are: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Seems like a principle set in stone. Of course, it does or does not include women depending on which way you choose to read it. And these words somehow co-existed for decades with slavery which seems to us to undercut their very roots. We see the contradiction because our Ethos is different although the constitution is the same. 
Britain has no constitution but it has developed into a fairly free and equal society on the basis of its ethos, its shared culture. On the other hand, a number of dictatorships have extremely liberal constitutions.
What you can set down in words are rules and constitutions. But an ethos develops over time in directions that cannot be pre-determined by words we write down. An ethos literally cannot be defined, it is a historically developing sense of broadly shared values.
Perhaps people will think this is just quibbling over terms, but terminology is crucial to the way we approach problems. We can speak of guiding principles or mottos, but what use are they, really? Take the fact that the Bible has ten commandments that include one that says "Thou shalt not kill", and a prophet / God who instructed his followers to turn the other cheek in the face of grave provocation. Has this made Christian cultures less inclined to go to war than non-Christian ones? Has the fact that the same prophet / God said a rich person has basically no chance of getting into heaven made Christians less likely to seek wealth than non-Christians? The answer is an emphatic no in each case, because believers simply interpret the words according to their ethos to the point where they can be taken to mean the exact opposite of what they say.
Words will always be twisted to fit the prevailing ethos. Any code will be taken when convenient like Captain Barbossa does, as "more what you would call guidelines than actual rules". Proceed with your crusade by all means, but understand that any success you have will lie in nudging changes in the ethos of the IC rather than defining an ethos for the NNS.

-------------------------

cryptoisgood | 2022-10-24 15:31:02 UTC | #45

So I hesitate to post this because I haven’t fully formed my thoughts around this yet but:

I think an ethos to the nns takes away its flexibility and I think it’s a mistake.

I think named neurons should have constitutions and ethos and people should follow these named neurons. I think having an “ethos” opens the door for people to weaponize it and demonize anyone with different ideas. 

Keep the NNS an agnostic voting tool with no political or moral alignment is my point.

In developer terms we shouldn’t couple together 2 things that don’t need to be coupled or it’s going to be hard to refactor later. 

Or another metaphor, we need to keep opinions, morals, and ideas decentralized to the named neurons.

I will vote no to anything like this but I will support it if everyone else does and it passes

These two points you make are basically guiding principles you're proposing for the NNS.

Maybe the word "scope" is better than "ethos", but literally there's no rule for anything right now so no one is right when making any argument about what the NNS should or shouldn't be or do.

Think of it this way:
If the point of the NNS is to become a global power (like a digital government), then it should be managed completely differently then if it's to simply be a steward of the technical aspects of maintaining the IC protocol. These are vastly different visions for the NNS, there's plenty of room to narrow the scope without sacrificing flexibility.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-24 15:44:48 UTC | #49

Yeah, maybe "Ethos" is the wrong word. What would you suggest as a better word?

Perhaps the comparisons to governments is distracting, because you can see from the examples for guiding principles that included that I don't think that's what the NNS should become.

**Think of it this way:**
We need a way to set accurate general expectations for what the NNS will do with it's power, so that token holders and projects can make long term decisions. Why would you build on a network where something could censor your canister, and you have literally nothing to go off of which could give you a clear indication of what might bring that situation about? How can you trust a token when more could be minting at any time, and there's not even a general idea of how and why that might happen?

The Ethos can change too, and if it changes to misalign with the needs of specific stakeholders, then those stakeholders need to know so that they can leave to join other web3 networks which do fit their needs. For example, if the community did want an NNS that could act as a central bank, then many projects would leave. Right now some are leaving simply due to the lack of certainty, which is a pity because I don't think the NNS Treasury thing will ever actually be implemented. If there was an Ethos opposing things like the NNS becoming a central bank, perhaps these projects would have less uncertainty in the future of the NNS and be willing to stay.

If the Ethos is largely ignored and problems arise, that can be called to attention to drive the promotion of either changes made to it (to generalize it further) or have more adherence to it. It'll just be a tool for helping drive general alignment, which won't be perfect but it can at least be an improvement on the current situation.

aiv | 2022-10-24 15:45:14 UTC | #50

The weak point of any protocol, lol.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-24 15:50:46 UTC | #51

It's not about making rules, it's about clarifying the current consensus. That's all.

If the NNS had an ethos which directed it to being a steward of the protocol, then it could still someday transform into something like a digital government. I'm not saying we even could put rules in place to prevented that from happening.

The difference is that this can happen deceptively and slowly, and without an ethos that shift would happen fairly unnoticed. If there's an ethos in place, then it'll need to be updating during the process of changing the NNS into something else, and that'll give community members like myself a clear indication that I'm starting to contribute to something I never wanted to be a part of.

As is a stands with the NNS right now, do any of us have any clear idea of exactly what the NNS is? What are we contributing to? I think it's worth taking some time to define that.

Feels like is just another voting procedure to get to the proposal.

icpjesse | 2022-10-24 16:25:24 UTC | #54

Similar to @cryptoisgood above, I'm still formulating exactly what I think on this topic, but wanted to chime in with a few notes:

[quote="aiv, post:1, topic:16090"]
The NNS has to right to violate any human rights of any group or individual in any situation.
[/quote]

Just awful stuff here. Honestly embarrassed to even have it proposed. All decisions take sides. This is a decision against human rights. I'm a hard no if this remains in the final proposal. Hiding behind technology or a DAO to shield from responsibility for the actions of the larger system is unconscionable in this context. 

[quote="aiv, post:1, topic:16090"]
However, the NNS does not define or determine justice, it simply provides neuron holders with a mechanism for flushing out extreme examples of content that directly stem from or facilitate the physical harm of innocent people against their will.
[/quote]

This is a mealy mouthed argument the opposite way - it's FINE for the NNS to violate human rights, except for when it's not? Honestly makes the NNS sound like one of the centralized corporation driven only for profit we want to move away from. 

On twitter, another argument was made for the need for this:
https://twitter.com/IsaacValadez55/status/1584564868673605632

I think the example of the US Constitution is telling - in the US system, the constitution provides a final check where the US Supreme Court rules exclusively on constitutional issues.  No such check exists here - so how would this be enforceable or actionable? 

[quote="aiv, post:1, topic:16090"]
Again, the NNS should not be the police, small claims court, or judge of the network, it’s censorship power is a tool of last resort to only be used against atrocities.
[/quote]

This... this is what the constitution sets up.  Exactly this. 

This proposal seems to be the exact thing it rails against - using the NSS proposal system to push forward a belief that can't be enforced via code. 

I'm def not arguing that change is needed - obviously it is. But this proposal strikes me as reactionary to another conversation happening regarding the NNS and treasury, and and rather than solving those questions (which I also don't know the right answers to!) grandstands a larger point without solving our problems.  There are good ideas in here, but I think they'd be better served as the guiding pricipales for a Issac founded voting neuron DAO than the whole NNS.

I fully agree with the need to decentralize further and I feel like that is the core driver of every idea I advocate.  In my mind, that needs to happen mechanically based on NNS code and tokenomic incentives.  

Believe it or not, I’m extremely uncomfortable about the fact that the Synapse vote triggers 10% voting power due to liquid democracy.  It’s the reason I have always wanted to be transparent about who we are and how we vote (synapse.vote) and I want to make it easy for the community to easily know the individual votes cast by each voting member (CrowdGov.org).  However, I can’t do anything about our liquid democracy other than try to drive further change.  I have lead the proposal for Manual Voting Throughout the Voting Period as well as Periodic Confirmation of Neuron Followees, both of which have the potential to significantly change the mechanics of how much liquid democracy the Synapse neuron casts.  They are also both “tokenomics changes” that would be counter to your proposed ethos.  Regardless, neither have been implemented because they have not made it to the roadmap for DFINITY.  Perhaps they think there are security issues.  More likely they are just too busy with higher priorities.  I’m left with feeling like the right answer is for the community to step up and drive some of these changes (funding required).  It doesn’t have to be on the DFINITY roadmap if it can be on the roadmap of some other organizations with the skills and credibility to collaborate with DFINITY.  That ultimately leads us to the decentralization we all want.

You have a brilliant mind for governance.  Respectfully, I encourage you to consider the mechanics of how decentralization can be achieved through code.  I don’t believe it can be achieved without tokenomic incentives.  An ethos is nice to have, but it’s not the solution.  I don’t think we want an ethos that stifles progress toward decentralization, so it’s important to give deep consideration of what that means.

Just awful stuff here. Honestly embarrassed to even have it proposed. All decisions take sides. This is a decision against human rights.
[/quote]

That was a typo, I fixed it. I'm specifically arguing that the NNS should never violate any human rights, I would have thought that obvious from the context.

Again, this content is not the content of the proposal, just rough examples of what guiding principles might look like

[quote="icpjesse, post:54, topic:16090"]
This is a mealy mouthed argument the opposite way - it’s FINE for the NNS to violate human rights, except for when it’s not?
[/quote]

No, I'm arguing that the NNS should try to avoid becoming a judge or rule of law in any matter beyond it's scope, which should simply be to manage the protocol.

[quote="icpjesse, post:54, topic:16090"]
I think the example of the US Constitution is telling - in the US system, the constitution provides a final check where the US Supreme Court rules exclusively on constitutional issues. No such check exists here - so how would this be enforceable or actionable?

I updated the topic a bit earlier today to address this. Basically, it's just a consensus tool.

[quote="icpjesse, post:54, topic:16090"]
This… this is what the constitution sets up. Exactly this.
[/quote]

Well there's an article in the constitution which provides for police powers to exist and it gives those to the state. In this case, I'd argue that the NNS should deny any right to police powers.

This is about adding clarity to the how the NNS is to be used, taking examples out of context isn't productive.

[quote="icpjesse, post:54, topic:16090"]
This proposal seems to be the exact thing it rails against - using the NSS proposal system to push forward a belief that can’t be enforced via code.
[/quote]

Decentralization is a value, is it not? Can it be fully enforced by code on the NNS? The NNS involves both technology and people, it needs both social and technical structures.

If people want to expand or reduce the powers of the NNS, there should be a shared consensus for determining how that's done.

In the end, it's all about signaling. Why should people contribute to the NNS, is there's nothing it stands for or represents? How to I know what it wants to become?

[quote="icpjesse, post:54, topic:16090"]
But this proposal strikes me as reactionary to another conversation happening regarding the NNS and treasury, and and rather than solving those questions (which I also don’t know the right answers to!) grandstands a larger point without solving our problems.
[/quote]

Yes it is a reaction. I realized the need for an Ethos specifically because all of the arguments surrounding the topic of the NNS Treasury were purely subjective. None of us can define what we are building with the NNS. There's no shared understanding or generally defined consensus.

You don't have to agree with the example principles I suggested, submit your own if you want. The only ask of this proposal is that we stop and take a moment to figure out what the NNS is and what it's role is, before we move forward with making drastic changes to it.

Sure, it won't solve every problem, but it would be a tool for navigating the path ahead.

First, as I've said before those were just examples, they aren't part of this proposal. Second, these two changes are actually reinforced and encouraged by Guiding Principle #2 in my examples, which states this in it's description:
"Since collusion and majority control by a small group would break the accessibility and impartiality of the NNS, the NNS may adopt measures that contribute to reducing the risk, impact, and incentives of collusion."

The #6 regarding tokenomic changes could probably be clarified, it's specifically opposing changes to the to flow of tokens in the sense of using inflation rates to manage the economy of the network via manual proposals, the way a central bank is managed through constant manipulation.

[quote="wpb, post:56, topic:16090"]

The community has no framework to come to even a rough consensus for how that funding should be supplied. The Ethos is about starting that process so that these kinds of things can start gaining momentum.

Personally, I think projects building on the IC need to take a more active role on the NNS, and the Ethos would be a helpful tool for driving that.

[/quote]

This is a call to get started building an Ethos, nothing has even been defined yet, so it's too soon to call this effort a failure.

For example, since you think tokenomic incentives are necessary, then what scope of tokenomic action is appropriate for the NNS to use towards achieving that? The community is clearly against giving the NNS complete "free reign" to do anything with tokenomics whenever it wants, but if you can think of a good guiding principle the community can rally behind which still allows room for your token incentives, then submit it as a proposal when we begin ratifying the Ethos.

In that way, the Ethos could be the solution you need for getting some tokenomic incentive you want to see, without driving apart the ecosystem. Those opposing a treasury would at least have a clear idea of the scope with which things would be done.

Sure, an Ethos alone is not a complete solution, but without one I think coming to peaceful consensus on any solutions will be significantly more difficult than it needs to be.

Yes, exactly. They would be able to do that.

This is about making major shifts in how the NNS is used more obvious and harder to hide.

When selling the idea of an NNS Treasury, they only need to sell voters on all of the "good" the money could do. Since right now everything is subjective, this is a strong argument. What's the NNS supposed to do anyways? Who knows?

Personally, I suspect that selling voters on a vision of the NNS that has central bank powers would be a lot harder than selling them on the idea of free money. In other words, proposals for an NNS Treasury only seem more attractive in the absence of guiding principles.

Without any guiding principles, how is any argument for or against an NNS Treasury anything other than purely subjective?

True, but there are still social expectations, they are just not as obvious.

For example, when someone makes a proposal without posting it on this forum for a few days first, it's usually voted down despite whatever it's contents are. That rule is mentioned on the forum and Twitter, but often missed by newbies to the ecosystem, yet it guides a majority of the voting power on the NNS.

Would child pornography be taken off the network by the NNS? Probably so.

What's wrong with adding a bit more clarity to these social expectations which already exist? That'll only help us unify around them, and make things more obvious when they begin to shift or get ignored. That alone can be useful.

dostro | 2022-10-24 19:24:12 UTC | #64

I'm not sure what exactly the problem is that having an "ethos for the NNS" would solve but it seems to come from the problem that governance and upgrade execution is too centralized for long-term viability, and we have thoughts about whether a solution to that (an NNS treasury) should even be allowed as a proposal.

Given that we want the IC to exist long after we're gone and that it'll run into circumstances we can't imagine today, why do we think ourselves knowledgeable enough to put limitations on what should be proposed before the IC even has a chance to prove itself as a viable world computer?

DFINITY has their development philosophy (and could publish it on their website just as Ethereum has). Identity Labs / NFID has theirs. I have mine. Etc etc. Many philosophies will overlap, some will specialize on certain aspects of development (i.e. technical, economic, legal, identity, funding), and that diversity of expertise is a fantastic property for the evolution of such a powerful internet protocol!

I propose we refocus on the problem because if ICP fails to gain traction in a few years, I'm of the opinion the "lack of NNS direction" wouldn't have been the cause.

It's not about whether or not something like the NNS Treasury should be allowed, it's about having a shared foundation for debating the validity of any proposal.

Is the goal of the NNS to be decentralize? Many of us assume so, but what do we base that assumption on? Is what "decentralized" means to me the same as what "decentralized" to you? How decentralized should the NNS be?

I'm proposing creating a living document that gives a foundation we can all use to determine if a proposal is or isn't aligned to the current consensus for what the NNS should be.

The "limits" would be basic things most of us already agree on, such as the ability to censor human trafficking marketplaces or to try and make the NNS decentralized. 

We won't get it right at the start, but it won't be static and doesn't need to be confining.

What problem? That money is tight? That crypto is in a bear market and the world is entering a global recession?

Is that within the scope of things the NNS can/should try to solve? According to who?

Without any type of ethos, all arguments regarding the NNS are nothing but subjective personal opinions. "Lack of NNS direction" means lack of direction for the protocol it controls. It means we've got no shared direction, no basic definition of what we want to build. This could easily be the reason ICP fails.

In fact, the reason ICP could succeed would be based on what's built on top of it, but a poorly managed NNS could cause it to fail despite whatever useful things are built on it.

Whether or not the IC is a web3 network, or a slightly democratized AWS alternative, basically depends on how we decide to collectively use the NNS.

IMO, this is a brilliant idea because it puts the onus for consistent behaviour upon all Named Neurons, who are putting themselves forward for stakers to follow. 

Stakers have a right to know how Neurons intend to behave and should be able to easily assess if the Neurons they follow deviate from published intentions, and unfollow if appropriate.

::edit::

This puts Accountability of Governance firmly in the hands of the individual voter/staker. The only real adjustments required are for each Named Neuron's approach to voting AND voting record to be accessible - probably through the II wallet.

Hey @Ciaran thanks for sharing.  Your comment resonates with me this time.  You had a big impression on me back during the supermario takedown debate and I didn’t recognize the wisdom in some of the points you made back then.  Definitely a lot to think about now.

[quote="Ciaran, post:346, topic:9424, full:true"]
I very well understand the goal of The IC to serve things the other blockchains can’t.

The problem is tokenised open Web 3.0 dApps - the things Dominic keeps shouting from the rooftops The IC was specifically built for - aren’t viable on a protocol with active governance of a ledger by humans. This is *especially* the case for governance by financial interests. States will absolutely not allow this.

So if we’re in a situation where the IC can’t work without governance yet also can’t work *with* governance then I ask the question do we have a viable project here? How is it going to work?

This is a good way to further define issues with any code for the NNS. Say something that could be child pornography is uploaded. An NNS vote takes it down. That is the way it would work right now. But suppose we had a written constitutional clause that says, "The NNS forbids child pornography". Now, there will be all kinds of trouble because there is no agreed upon definition of child pornography. Are the photographs of girls taken by Lewis Caroll pornographic? Is Caravaggio's cupid pornographic? In many nations young children customarily go about naked and there is no taboo to photographing them in that state. This was the case even in the west not so long ago. But now it is an absolute taboo. Even the baby in Nirvana's Nevermind album cover now has its genitals masked in most media coverage. So, which country's attitude do we foreground as the ultimate truth? While everything stays on a case by case basis, I am confident that the freedom loving ethos of crypto will restrict censorship to  images everyone accepts are depraved. But put down an NNS rule and lobbyists will have a ball pressuring the NNS to 'act in accordance with standards it has set for itself'.

I have been on the record for supporting the Governance Working Group, so I thought I would step in and share my two cents:

1. Governance Working Group in a protocol is of course not the monopoly on authority. In a protocol, power only lies where the community believes authority lies. It is up to the GWG to show itself useful to the community to earn this.

2. The GWG was not designed to snuff all other dialogue, of course

3. The GWG is extremely open. It even rotates meeting times so it can be friendly to people in many timezones. It has open notes and open mic. 

4. The GWG is still forming and its taking active inputs from people as to how do that. It can only do this with the community's consent. It even has three co-leads (one from Asian Timezone, one from Europe/Africa Timezone, and one from Americas timezone) on order to be more inclusive.

5. GWG sessions are recorded and posted publicly. No better way to see whats going on.

Ok, this is a lot of "what if" speculation trying to make issue which doesn't exist. There's no way that setting "no child pornography" as a guiding principle would result in to addition of more child pornography to the network, and any semantics would be argued by the community whether an Ethos existed or not.

Defining an understanding/expectation of how/when censorship powers of the NNS would be used, is just a tool to removing uncertainty and driving unity.

If I'm making a dapp, it's useful to know what situations are likely for me to have my canisters removed by the NNS. Is it if any law is broken in any country? Is it if a competitor claims I owe them money? Or is it only for extreme and horrific situations?

For one thing, because no immutable blockchain exists that can host these kinds of dapps, nor will one ever be created. The fact that it does not exist is not accidental. Because if you had such an immutable blockchain, how would you keep child porn off of it? Anybody could just upload and then it is there for ever and nobody can undo it, right?

Look, either use the Ethos or ignore it, there's no need to strictly enforce it other than having it serve as a social statement, and there's no harm in starting the process of making one. It's just a few proposals. 

If you think "adding any scope or definition to the NNS is wrong", then you're free to create a proposal to add that as a guiding principle to the Ethos. If the community adopts it, you'll get what you want.

Heihachi | 2022-10-25 08:06:21 UTC | #78

Imo the big problem is the misleading use of words such "democracy" ,"ethos", "decentralized", "treasury".
Reinventing democracy is a waste of time.
It is well written and organized centuries ago and what it has to be done is just apply it in a new governance type like NNS.
Decentralization is not anarchy.
Decentralization needs some type of neutral leadership especially in PoS.

To me, treasury must be more like a reserve than another funding system like community fund.

So first of all change the name from treasury to reserve.
Reserve can be used partially as another source to empower community fund (applied only by proposal) or as a burning mechanism.
If Dominic and dfinity wants more nodes, then they can give their grants to make more nodes.
Additionally dfinity and his whale neurons can fund these nodes from their daily huge rewards.

There are many many other sensitive cases that if they are not treated properly, ICP is in danger of lobbying.

What controls NNS? Of course the control of VP%. So resseting every 4 months the followees, we can achieve a more fair distribution of this control.

But I still believe what matters most is not the daily voting. It is what is proposed, what are the rewards for and mainly the implementation of these proposals

I have another idea for the VP control.
1. Followees are forbidden to follow other followees
2. Each followee neuron can only control a max of 2% of total VP. (This might change in time)

The unallocated rewards end up to reserve.

Community fund needs more details. How much are being needed to fund projects?

For example in Crowdfund every projects set a minimun target to launch.
We must have these details in community fund. 

I have to mention here that imo Crowdfund is much more fair type of ICO than Community Fund of NNS.

The rest icp should be burned.
I had the idea of being converted into cycles for future use, but with that way there is no way ICP gains value since everything will be free for everybody.

Everyone if free to decide on their vision for decentralisation and how to get there. My only question is whether ICP can hold more than on governance system. From the initial discussions I have had this seems possible and this is what we should be working towards. People can then decide what governance suits their vision and this will also help to scale realistic investment and decentralisation. If one governance is the pursuit, ICP will fail as decentralising tech

The Ethereum Foundation does not have content moderation principles embedded in its philosophy. Please refer to the discussion around the Super Mario 64 takedown, where members wrote comprehensively about the importance of maintaining a hands-off attitude to censorship at protocol level the way Ethereum does with NFTs. If Ethereum had content guidelines for NFTs in its philosophy, they would then become responsible for content in a way they are not as a neutral platform.  

On the IC, individual dapps can enforce their own community standards and formulate content moderation strategies, but the IC as a whole should not. To your question about why any dapps will build on the IC when they are unsure about what is allowed, the answer is that an NNS vote is actually a far higher barrier to takedowns and offers *more* certainty than any set of guidelines would do. Please look at the experience of users on Web2 social media where community guidelines are prevalent. An army of content moderators has to be employed by platforms at great cost to enforce those standards and at the end of it users have no idea what is actually allowed and what is not, what will cause their accounts to be frozen or their posts to be disallowed, nor do they get any reasoning behind it except for generic messages.

I know you are not trying to start a government, quite the contrary. But a bureaucracy will be the unintended consequence of any attempts to place content-related guidelines at the NNS level.

My favoured scenario is the NNS going by the way of the Dodo which means everyone giving up yes :)

In most chains node operators only 'vote' by choosing which version of the software to run. Development is done via discussion on research forums and calls by people with the expertise to participate. A rough consensus emerges and is then presented as a hard fork which people can choose to run or not. There is no way for the core developers to force this change on users. This is key when considering both the coordination problem that heavily favours strong consensus it creates - a problem the IC doesn't create by eschewing governance by hard forks and formalising simply majority rule coin voting - and also how a regulatory body might view the system. That's to say whether there are fiduciaries that must be brought to heel in the system or not. 

In web 2.0 there are discussions within companies who tend to have intellectual property rights over their product (it's not open source, free to use) and those employees have legal obligations to their shareholders who in turn have legal obligations. The identities of shareholders are known and minority shareholders are protected by law. The NNS OTOH is totally opaque. Nobody knows who's who and how they're voting. Then of course, unlike shareholders, there is no legal obligation by anyone to follow through on their wishes. If the core dev team doesn't like a vote they can simply ignore it. As a system of governance for something with the IC's global goals this is a joke to put it mildly. 

So although I agree with much of what you've written as an ethos/set of rules/whatever for the NNS, it too is completely unenforceable. It's like putting a bandaid on a cancerous tumor and hoping it fixes the problem. It won't.

I'm glad my message is getting across. If we want the IC to be a globally neutral platform trusted by billions, rather than mired in politics, it needs less governance not more.

Looks like DFINITY does not understand what neutrality means.



Every time these organizations bring up new governance proposals, they are just complicating the governance and introducing additional trust assumptions.

A trustworthy independent reliable autonomous system must be applied.
The whole turns to be a chase for voting control and proposals implementation control rather than voting.

I insist that first of all must be a reset of followees.

Then set a max control of VP%. A good start is 2%.
In that point I must mention that every decision must be made only for vitality of ICP rather than maximizing rewards.
So autocompound maturity must 100% connected with VP% of each followee individually.

Lets say ICDevs control 2% which has already been setted as the max allowed control of VP%.

After autocompounding, this is increased to 2.01%.
Then automatically is applied the reset of followees.

If some neurons dont see that and (bad for them) they abstain from rewards after sudden resetting, then the unallocated rewards go to reserve and then the community decides what to do with them.

I just wanted to support everything you are saying.  I’ve tried to make these points in different forms already so I don’t feel the need to reiterate further.  

@aiv please know that @Denis is not the only person who has made these points.  They have been made by quite a few people in this thread.  In every case you seem more interested in arguing back why they are wrong and you are right instead of listening.

Can you elaborate a bit more please? the working group has met multiple times in a month. Has its own discord channel, GitHub, etc… 

I think it’s fair to say you are too busy to follow their progress, but I think they meet fairly frequently. Every other working group meets every 4-6 weeks. 

Or did I misunderstand your intent?

yes of course I follow this ->

Certainly, seems like being vigilant about a blockchain governance system such as NNS is a full-time job without pay. Especially after the tokenomics fiasco that DFINITY cooked up with ICPMN.


IMO,a good blockchain is one that requires the least amount of human intervention via governance. A working group meeting every 4-6 weeks seems weak. By introducing governance working groups, you are forcing participants such as I to take part in it or miss out on the development. Also in my opinion, there is no need for a 'working group' for governance if it can meet every week. This, however, is my two cents.


And yes, I was criticizing dfinity in general on how it interacts with the community. Is DFINITY blind to the rest of the world, or is it only in favor of ICPMN?


Read this post on how DFINITY is obscuring information wrt governance -> 

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/voting-no-on-all-proposals-that-don-t-have-a-link-to-here/16065/19?u=catpirate


I don't understand why anyone would trust this forum or DFINITY after all the bad faith practices DFINITY is engaging in along with ICPMN. Apparently, this nonprofit organization is good at picking sides instead of being neutral.



DFINITY has a broken grant system, broken comms, broken governance, and a terrible reputation among the web3 community to top it off.

DFINITY will just pump out more ICPMN propaganda to increase the voting power. Such a good friendship these people have.

I think this is a bit harsh and unfair, DFINITY and @diegop are just doing their best.

We need to stop relying on DFINITY so much, and I think that'll happen over time. Let's just focus on making the changes we can and taking next steps.

Don't mind me, I'm only fudding the NNS right now. If its a useless statement, it can be ignored.

Heihachi | 2022-10-25 13:56:50 UTC | #92

I had suggested that votes should be counted by neurons not staked icp.
Which means if someone has 1 million tokens in a single neuron then his vote counts 1.
If someone wants to create o1 million neurons of 1 icp just to win the voting result then something is wrong with him.
The distribution of rewards will be according to staked icp.
But unfortunately this has been ignored.
So setting VP% control at 2% and automated resetting when this rises at 2.01% for example then we can control that big neurons cant win this game.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-25 13:59:32 UTC | #93

I don't think any neuron owners would be happy with abstracting away from current liquid democracy, for this idea to work, we need proven proof of human solutions. I had previously thought about this. One could apply this idea to the governance voting/motion proposals and keep the reward the same across the maintenance proposals.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2022-10-25 14:00:20 UTC | #94

These Neurons are not proposing any great long-term viable solutions, most of the NNS solutions have been short-term oriented and easily exploitable ones.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-25 14:03:52 UTC | #95

We ready passed a proposal for automatically resetting the neuron followees, we need to push to have that implemented!

After we define on ethos, I was planning to use it to argue for a quadratic balancing of follow voting power. Basically these means that neurons direct the flow of less voting power per follower the more followers they have, meaning there would be no whale known neurons. Tokenomics and maturity would be unchanged, only the amount of voting power hitting the proposals. So basically, the only impact between following a large known neuron and a less popular known neuron, would be that your end influence on the outcomes of proposals would be slightly greater if you choose the less popular known neuron.

If everyone could register and take the courses in this compliance link. Maybe DFINITY/ community should come up with this type of solution/ ability to register and take courses such as these. 

Anyone creating a research project (especially containing human subjects) *should* be educated on the very basics of ethical standards. Actually, according to these courses, anyone with 5k invested shouldn't speak on issues because of biases. Just throwing this out there. I recommend DFINITY register, create, and employ some sort of standard.

-------------------------

aiv | 2022-10-25 14:40:15 UTC | #98

It's not even specifically about ethics, just some types of general guidelines regarding usage.

When will the NNS censor things?

When will the NNS mint more ICP?

What's the general scope/purpose of the NNS? What shouldn't the NNS get involved in?

Should the NNS have a goal of being decentralized? (we assume yes, but this isn't ratified anywhere by the community yet so technically no goals exist.)

Should the NNS be accessible and inclusive? Should it be focused on the long term health of the ecosystem?

Things like this! Most of them seem obvious, but right now we can only argue proposals based on our opinions, solidifying a few basic principles will let us root goals like decentralization into a shared foundation/consensus, to help us make arguments that are objective.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-10-25 18:26:02 UTC | #99

Nice food for thought.
I insist the goal is to come to an almost fully automated process.
And since icp is inflationary an automated process of emergency deflation should be applied.
Everyone who is concerned of might loosing his daily rewards isn't something that NNS or ICP must take into any serious consideration.

Like your keys your coins it is your neurons your votes.
