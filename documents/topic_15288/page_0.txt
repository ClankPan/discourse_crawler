### Who are we?
We are from the [ICP 8yeargang信仰群](https://oc.app/#/a6ew7-jyaaa-aaaaf-adsaq-cai) , the number one Chinese language community in Openchat.

We are a group of NFH (Non-Fungible Human) who love ICP, respect diversity, and encourage inward (philosophy) - outward (knowledge) exploration in both directions.

Any member who display their 8-year NNS staking screenshot can become a group administrator, and eventually the community will be completely decentralized.

### keywords
Love, Link, belong, Inclusion, Dedication, Co-creation

### Slogan
Create value for every ICP 8yeargang

### What are we doing?
We are building a spiritual home that truly belongs to the ICP 8 yeargang community, and we believe that
- Beyond making money, we are more interested in exploration new possibilities on IC;
- Share the vision of ICP and expand our Chinese language community;
- Driven by curiosity rather than opportunism.

### Where are we going?
ICP 8yeargang is breeding seeds for freedom, the sunlight is fair to all, where these seeds will potentially grow towards an unimaginable shape and size.

### Why we want to become a named neuron?
After an 8-year staking, we put our entire trust and enthusiasm on participation of NNS. As the largest Chinese community in OC, it is our responsibility to lead the entire community members to be deeply involved in the daily governance of NNS, specifically we will
- Make sure NNS proposal is well understood in the Chinese language community, be the bridge between NNS and community.
- Answers members' questions.
- Vote by community representatives to create a consensus community vote
- Work and communicate with every member to make sure the proposal is best represented.

We believe it is important to be the naming neuron of 8yeargang because we always look at governance issues from both a macro (top-down) and community (bottom-up) perspective. Because of this unique perspective, we hope to gain the acceptance of the IC community and become an important representative force for public participation in NNS governance.

### 我们是谁?
我们来自Openchat第一大中文社区[ICP 8yeargang信仰群](https://oc.app/#/a6ew7-jyaaa-aaaaf-adsaq-cai)，我们是一群热爱IC，尊重差异，鼓励向内（哲学）-向外（求知）的双向探索的NFH(Non-Fungible Human)，任何公开自己8年质押证明的成员都可以成为群管理，最终社区将实现完全去中心化管理

### 关键词
爱，链接，归属，包容，奉献，共创

### 口号
为每个ICP 8yeargang创造价值

### 我们在做什么?
我们正在建立一个真正属于ICP 8yeargang社区的精神家园，我们认为：
不单单以赚钱为目的，更是探索与学习
不急于排斥扩大规模，更愿意志同道合
不过度盲目追逐风口，更鼓励兴趣为之

### 我们要去哪
ICP 8yeargang是一片孕育自由和真实种子的土壤，在这里，每一寸阳光都是公平的，这些种子未来成长出的样子我们无法想象

### 为什么我们要成为命名神经元？
作为8年质押的ICP忠实信徒，没有什么能比深入参与NNS治理更神圣的工作了，作为OC最大中文社区，有责任带领整个社区成员深入参与NNS的日常治理工作，具体而言我们将：
- 针对每一个NNS提案对所有成员进行宣讲, 成为NNS与社区之间的桥梁。
- 对于成员的疑问进行解答。
- 通过社区代表投票最终形成社区投票共识
- 集合社区的智慧，提出对生态有价值的提案

我们认为8yeargang成为命名神经元至关重要，因为我们始终同时站在宏观（自上而下）和社区（自下而上）两个角度看待治理问题，正因为这样独特的视角，我们希望能够获得IC社区的认同，成为大众参与NNS治理的重要代表力量。
