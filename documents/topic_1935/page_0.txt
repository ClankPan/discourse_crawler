Hey everybody! ðŸ‘‹

As Alexa mentioned in a [previous post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/candid-ui-has-a-new-look/1887), the Candid web UI has recently undergone a redesign ðŸ¥³

We would LOVE to hear your feedback in terms of your thoughts around the updated Candid web UI and additional features you'd like to see. We read all feedback and your insights will help inform future changes.

Please fill out the [Candid UI survey](https://internetcomputer.typeform.com/to/V9cgBJKG). We are looking forward to continuing to incorporate your feedback to improve the overall developer experience ðŸ¤©

I want to give a pre-emptive "thank you" to folks who take the time to answer feedback to help us improve!

And post-emptive (?) thank you to those who have already for the past year :slight_smile:
