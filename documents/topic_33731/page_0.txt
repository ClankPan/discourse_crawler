The unavailability is actually on the Bitcoin testnet canister (which cktestBTC is using when settling transactions on the bitcoin testnet network). The reason is that we're doing a re-bootstrap of the Bitcoin testnet canister to get it unblocked because it was in a state that was unupgradable. You can read more in the relevant [proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/131409).

We expect that the canister will be back to business in the next couple of days.

FYI, the Bitcoin testnet canister is again fully synced with the tip of the network and should be functional.
