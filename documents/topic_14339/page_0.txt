seeing example and demo, I saw that user deposit btc from a btc wallet to the canister. 
is this the only way to do that?
Q1: Can this be done like, " user calls a function of a canister and that function handles the deposit of the btc on the behalf of user?"

Q2:
```rust
pub struct SendTransactionRequest {
    pub transaction: Vec<u8>,
    pub network: Network,
}
```
here what data is passed in the transaction field?
address of the receiver? amount to be send to the receiver? 
combination of amount + receiver address ?

Q1:

As far as I know the only way to get bitcoins on a canister is by making a user send bitcoins from his wallet to the Bitcoin canister address.

Q2:

As described in [the Internet Computer Interface Specification](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec/#ic-bitcoin_send_transaction), `bitcoin_send_transaction` requires to:
> specify a `blob` of a Bitcoin [signed] transaction

You can find out the format of a Bitcoin transaction [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction).
So in addition to other fields as described above, the address of the receiver and the amount to be send to the receiver are part of the Bitcoin transaction.
These **two draft PRs** adding more detailed examples in [Rust](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/pull/280/files#diff-8c69dea28fd2d109074bc9f748f1b98eb3ce19f689f811add46983c452103845R32-R99) and [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/examples/pull/281/files#diff-5b452b3947288002cd0b0bf245010061a0f4ad295a469135b7d388cd2f0c2d2aR57-R96) may give you a precise idea on how to broadcast to the Bitcoin network a Bitcoin transaction.
