Hello,
I meet a gateway problem when I trying to get the file through http_request directly.
If the http request stream has no call back, then the file can be accessed , but if it has call back, the Nginx bad gateway error will be triggered
The http_request and http_streaming_call_back can be used before, but the call back can not work these days. 
Is this problem made by the ic replica version upgrade?

I donâ€™t know much about this but it looks like your  `StreamingToken` type may be missing one or two fields.

I have solved the problem.
The reason why I can't use the http_streaming_call_back is I add the 'content length' into the http header.
It works when I delete it from the http head field.
