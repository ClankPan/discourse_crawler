I installed the cli tool following the docs, but after creating a new project with `dfx new what` (ignore the dirname.. lol), running dfx start (from the what dir) spits out this error:

‚ûú  what git:(main) ‚úó dfx start
Running dfx start for version 0.15.1

I also deleted and re-installed the cache via dfx cache, to no avail.

What system are you running this on?

Not able to reproduce this, can you give more details about your setup ?

Running on an M1 MacBook Pro. After nuking/reinstalling the binary a few times, I got the local environment running after running dfx start --clean. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

same issue. upon running: dfx start, error: Running dfx start for version 0.17.0
Using the default definition for the 'local' shared network because /home/rk/.config/dfx/networks.json does not exist.
Initialized replica.
Dashboard: htp://localhost:40683/_/dashboard - Nothing is showing if i open this AND  upon running: dfx stop, error: Using the default definition for the 'local' shared network because /home/rk/.config/dfx/networks.json does not exist. - I have tried modifying the dfx.json file with the help of google's gemini but of no use

Hi @whitedevil9991,

It seems that you **did** successfully start a local replica and then stop it.

The message you saw when running both `dfx start` and `dfx stop` was **not** an error message. 
```txt
Using the default definition for the ‚Äòlocal‚Äô shared network because /home/rk/.config/dfx/networks.json does not exist.
```

It informed you that it didn't find a `networks.json` file at the path which can be used to configure the local replica behavior. So it proceeded with a default setting to start and stop the local replica.

After running `dfx run`, you said "Nothing is showing". This is expected behavior since there was no interaction with the started replica. In a different CLI window, you can execute other `dfx` commands, e.g. `dfx deploy`.

@lwshang  Hello, i am facing the same problem as @Cakeday  
you said it  didn't find networks.json file in the path and i am facing the same issue so how can i add networks.json in the path? and where to find it from?

You don't need a `networks.json` file to start a local replica.
Without the `networks.json`, `dfx start` will start the local replica with default configuration.

You can customize some configuration by providing a `networks.json` file at the suggested path. This is **optional**.

You can find more info in this page: [Defining custom networks](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/developer-tools/cli-tools/advanced-dfx/networks-json)

@Cakeday Hey! did you find the solution?

-------------------------

lwshang | 2024-05-13 14:47:49 UTC | #10

Cakeday solved the original issue by running `dfx start --clean`.

The error message in the top of this forum thread implied that there might be some unload-able replica state data. That was likely caused by a previous run of `dfx start` using an old `dfx` version. After upgrading `dfx`, the state data format changed and the old data cannot be loaded.

The `--clean` flag will delete the previous local replica state data and start a new local replica instance with fresh clean state.
