I have tried to exchange for the wallet address through identity in my own container, but the address I exchanged is inconsistent with the address under nns, I want to know, is there any rule restriction that causes the exchanged address to be inconsistent with the address under nns ?

This is the wallet address converted in the container: a43b201c7528da64dd422d19af1589d3b7ce1784f6ae36807057ec735ef160eb
This is the wallet address under nns, which is correct: bddcdbf32feccda684b8d72eb203510af0c3fdbbac3a246d6fa6cd04388d2e33

Will the nns code be open source?
