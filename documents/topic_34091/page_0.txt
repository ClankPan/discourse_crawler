Hi @andrea, @bitdivine, can I ask if you're aware of a reliable way of associating a specific historic `CreateSubnet` proposal with the subnet that it created. Many recent ones include 'Motivation' information in the proposal summary that unambiguously reveals the subnet that it refers to. However this isn't always the case. Here is an example [Proposal: 35948 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/35948)

> Motivation: Increase the capacity of the network

I can think of some heuristic approaches to mapping these historic proposals to the relevant subnet, but I haven't come up with a reliable approach. Are you aware of information stored anywhere that records the proposal that was used for creating each subnet (defining the config that the subnet started out with)?

-------------------------

By looking inside the registry, it should be possible to determine the registry version at which the subnet was created, and then possibly the time. But maybe @msumme has better ideas on how to do this?

If you have all subnet creation proposals, one thing you could do is to sort them by execution time and then match them with the list of subnets in the registry, which is sorted by creation time. You can obtain this from the registry, e.g. by using ic-admin:

```
$ ./ic-admin --nns-url https://ic0.app get-subnet-list

Using NNS URLs: ["https://ic0.app/"]

Thanks @andrea, this sounds like a good approach if the list of subnets can be depended on to be ordered by creation time. Thanks for pointing this out!

Thanks again @andrea. This appears to have largely done the trick, except for a minor limitation. There appear to be 32 executed `CreateSubnet` Subnet Management proposals historically (and a few others that either failed or were rejected). This means there are 5 subnets unaccounted for in terms of `CreateSubnet` proposals. It definitely makes sense that the NNS subnet wouldn't be created this way, but that leaves 4 Verified Application subnets unaccounted for.

The first executed `CreateSubnet` proposal appears to be [Proposal: 20 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/20) 
> Add verified_application subnet number 5 (commit 8a560f9510b0df9e747ffaede3b731f2ade9c0b7) 

Do you know how these four Verified Application subnets would have been created?

 - 4zbus-z2bmt-ilreg-xakz4-6tyre-hsqj4-slb4g-zjwqo-snjcc-iqphi-3qe

This may be related to the fact that some historic proposal are not retrievable (or the ID was skipped for some reason) - e.g. [Proposal: 19 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org)](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/19)

@msumme are you able to explain this?

-------------------------

Ah right, good catch I forgot about that.

This has to do with the bootstrapping the Internet Computer. At a high level bootstrapping the IC involved 3 steps toward launching a decentralized network:
1. Enrolling nodes from several data centers around the world, so that a single entity would control the entire network.
2. Generate the keys of the NNS subnet in a distributed way and starting the NNS subnet.
3. Setting up a decentralized governance that would be in control of all changes to the internet computer. This consisted of installing the governance canister with the initial neuron allocations for the various cohorts of initial investors.

The Internet Computer officially launched on May 10 when the ICP ledger went live and tokens became tradable, but the above bootstrapping steps took several days to complete. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGmlfLW3scA) explaining the bootstrapping process if you are interested in knowing a bit more about it.

Pre-launch, in between step 2 and 3 there was a short period of time where governance was not yet decentralized, which is when those four app subnets were created. The process was exactly the same as it is today, however those proposals are not visible because in step 3 the governance canister was reinstalled and its initial decentralized state was set. Thus proposals predating the reinstallation are no longer available. However, the registry has never been reinstalled since the creation of the NNS subnet and its state contains all the mutations to the IC configurations since bootstrapping. So if you want to dig out the initial configurations of those subnets you can look inside the registry and see when the subnet records were added. I am not sure what's the best way to do that, probably using the registry client from the monorepo to fetch all the deltas (@msumme may have better suggestions here).

> This may be related to the fact that some historic proposal are not retrievable (or the ID was skipped for some reason) - e.g. [Proposal: 19 - ICP Dashboard (internetcomputer.org) ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/19)

I think those are just "private" [neuron management](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/proposal-advanced#topic-neuronmanagement-restricted-voting) proposals that are not indexed by the dashboard.

This is really useful and interesting info, thanks @andrea! I'll enjoy that video later after work.

This sounds promising, thank you. I'll take a look when I next get a chance :slightly_smiling_face:
