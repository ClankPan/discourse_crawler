Example:

i have X ICP and place them into a Neuron for 365days and get a voting power of Y.

A.) In order to get back my ICP currently locked for 365d, *when* do i need to start disolving my neuron? *after* the 365d have passed? Also, if so, do i get them immediately, or is there another delay i need to think of?

B.) Voting: when can i vote? Is it immediately after locking ICP into a neuron *or* after the delay (365d)?

You have to start dissolving 365 days before you want to get them out

Immediately for any proposal that is created _after_  locking. In practice this roughly means that after 4 days you can vote on every proposal that is open

To simplify even more you need a minimum 6 months lock to be able to vote. As @Severin very accurately described you can vote from day one if the min 6 mo is in place and starting on proposals created after you did the staking. One thing to consider is that when you reach the last 6 months remaining to dissolve you can no longer cast a vote, so take that into your calculations. So in your example for one year if you start after 6 months you will get rewards for voting for 1 year but will be able to withdraw after 1 and a half year.

Sorry, more questions:

Is it then "usual" to lock them in a neuron for X days and immediately after start dissolving?

The longer a neuron remains in a non-dissolving state, the more the bonus increases. So some people keep the neuron locked to receive a larger bonus.
