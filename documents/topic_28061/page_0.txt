Creating a community-oriented economy stream on the platform of the ICP blockchain by the COE project, an idea that has started its activity since 05/01/2023 with the help of creating a collection of ap-coe NFTs.
**In this article, we will examine the current state of the COE project and reports on the short-term COE roadmap will be presented to the community.**

**Status of ap-coe NFTs**

The ap-coe NFTs collection is built with the aim of growing the community and distributing free shares in a community-oriented manner among the users of the ICP blockchain. To date, more than 8 thousand NFTs have been distributed from the ap-coe collection.
Of course, the COE project was able to publicize its idea in the Instagram space and in the Asian crypto community with the help of distributing these NFTs and guide new people to ICP and the use of tools.
Each NFT from the ap-coe collection is worth 42 COE tokens. These NFTs allow the community to participate in DAO voting. Also, the holders of this NFT collection are included in the white list of the sp-coe section.

The ap-coe collection has been distributed to the community in promotional or educational events. It has more than 71 investors and has generated income for 284 people.
Up to now, ap-coe's NFT collection has more than 1000 transactions. The financial turnover of this NFT collection is more than 184 ICP.

* All NFTs are freely distributed but less than 3% of all distributed NFTs are listed for sale.
* More than 38% of listed NFTs are priced above 0.2 ICP.

In the statistics of the holders, we can see that more than 68% of the holders of the ap-coe NFT collection hold only one NFT. Fairness in the distribution of NFTs is acceptable.

**Checking the status of the COE token**

Tokonomics COE:
* COE token standard: ICRC-1
* Total Supply: 21 million
* Transfer fee: 0.0001 ICP
* The token burns: Yes

distribution structure:
* 2% between ap-coe NFTs
* 1% between sp-coe NFTs
* 5% between coe NFTs
* 2% airdrop
* 5% business partners
* 5% for the development team
* 15% liquidity
* 15% Pool support
* 50% of the farm

In the token distribution structure, the part related to COE NFTs can also be considered for sale on SNS. On the way, after successfully passing the sp-coe stage, we can vote to merge with SNS. Success in the sp-coe stage can change the fate of the project.

**COE token transactions**
Currently, the only way to trade the COE token is the BABYAROF/COE trading pair pool.
The creation of the first traditional business with the investment of the BABYAROF team has voluntarily created the BABYAROF/COE trading pool. 1% of COE's total liquidity was allocated to this collaboration, creating the first trading pool.

Until now, COE token has managed to register 2304 successful transactions.

The number of holders who hold more than 1 COE token is less than 100 wallets

**The status of the first stage of fundraising (sp-coe)**

The first independent project that has started to operate in the sp-coe phase is the ALP project. The ALP project is also planned as an independent project in the first round of COE fundraising.
In the sp-coe section, the purpose of advertising is for the COE project, which has led to the birth of the ALP project.

The price of ALP NFTs has been determined by the community in the first voting event of the COE project on the ICPswap platform.
So far, the ALP project has managed to attract 166 ICPs and has 10 months left to sell another 263 NFTs.
Each NFT of the ALP collection is insured with 210 COE tokens. Also, ALP is an independent project that has its own token structure.
The role of the ALP project is very colorful. The COE project will add a specified amount of 1% of its liquidity to the backing of the BABYAROF/COE trading pair. In the next step, we will spend half of the ALP capital to buy BABYAROF and convert it into COE tokens so that we can create the ALP/COE trading pool with the purchased COE tokens.
The other half of the funds attracted by ALP will be used to create ALP/ICP liquidity pool.
The COE token will be floated and the purchase of COE tokens will be much easier with the help of the ALP trading route.

**Making ALP animations**

Creating short animations aimed at promoting the ICP ecosystem platforms as well as the COE project. A science fiction story that gradually became an animated story.
ALP animations carry messages for the future that are mysteriously recorded in the ICP blockchain.

**Rewards for COE token holders**
If the BABYAROF family is approved in the DAO, there is a possibility that we will once again start staking for the COE token.

**FOOD.COE opening status**
The opening of FOOFCOE has been delayed, but thanks to the BABYAROF team, the branding standards have been met and we can imagine a positive future for this traditional business.
It is expected that after the start of the activity, we will be able to experience the growth of the financial inflow for the COE token.

**How is the integration of FOOD.COE with COE token planned?**
An NFT collection called food.coe will be created on the ICPswap platform. A NFT from the food.coe collection will be gifted to the customers who join the customer club.
10% of food.coe's financial input will be used to purchase COE tokens. (with the help of BABYAROF/COE trading pair) these purchased tokens will be distributed to the holders of FOOD.COE NFTs every month.

> Of course, the implementation of this plan will be implemented in the framework of the standard COE white paper.
