I'm trying to use Stoic wallet in my project to authenticate canister calls, but I am getting this error:

`There was an error - please ensure you have Cookies Enabled (known issue for Brave users)`

The   StoicIdentity.load() is not loading anything at all it's just returning false and that error.

If I initialize my actor soon after connecting, it's giving the error when I try to make the call:

My current setup:

```
 const updateStoicClient = async () => {
    try {
      if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
        StoicIdentity.load().then(async (identity: any) => {
          if (identity !== false) {
            initStoicActor(identity);
          } else {
            identity = await StoicIdentity.connect();
            initStoicActor(identity);
          }
        });
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Error in connectStoicWallet:", error);
    }
  };

  const initStoicActor = (identity: any) => {
    setPrincipalId(identity.getPrincipal().toText());

    const _backendActor =
      Actor.createActor<ActorSubclass<BACKENDSERVICE> | null>(
        backendIDL,
        {
          agent: new HttpAgent({
            identity,
            host: host,
          }),
          canisterId: backendCanisterId,
        }
      );

    setBackendActor(_backendActor);
  }
```

I was using Brave, I tried using Chrome as well and no change, I'm not sure if this is really a cookies problem

I looked in the wallet code, [here](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/stoic-wallet/blob/5d51bab987ea60560a5f8640a5f84df8fb8b44c1/src/index.js#L59-L122), it's looking for _db in localstorage which is not being set, it's not being set because of the Cookies Being Disabled?

What can I do on my side or something need to be fixed on the wallet side?

Thanks @baolongt , I tried on my Chrome and Brave, for some reason I can't find the experimental third party one on my PC, just a bunch of other experimentals.

It's name might have changed a slight bit, in these docs it's called differently: https://iloveics.gitbook.io/icpswap/products/wallet/stoic-wallet-cookies-problem-solution

Also make sure to click on the (i) in front of the url and allow 3rd party cookies from there too.

As far as I understand, there hasn't been any development on Stoic for a while.

Oh no! did you try in another browser. Or you can change to another wallet SDK

You might have forgotten this step, by default 3rd party cookies are blocked nowadays.
