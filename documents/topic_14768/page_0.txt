So after reading about Tornado Cash getting Banned etc. I am wondering how this will affect Spinner Cash?, and if Spinner Cash, doesn't do anything about it, or change/adapt. Will this not result in a bad future for IC?. 

Share your thoughts, and idea's. To make it clear, im not here to spread FUD, im here, to learn and hear your thoughts to make better decisions and understand how things like this can impact other projects etc.

Just to give some context to those who aren't aware of what happened: Tornado Cash a popular mixer service on ETH has been banned in the US, all addresses have been put on a blacklist, funds in USDC frozen, the Git repo has been deleted and contributors banned, the contract is still there and usable though.

The way I see it if IC can't run a similar dApp then it has no place in Web 3 and hasn't much reasons to exist, if it can't even handle a bit of heat then it's not a decentralized world computer but just AWS with extra steps.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-08 22:42:11 UTC | #3

Exactly. ICP is an open global protocol and mixers should have no worries of being blocked on the IC. If not, there is no point for its existence like you say.  These issues will stress if the IC has any Decentralization bone in its body. 

Now if spinner team doesn't want to launch the service that's understandable.

Thank you for the Context, my bad for not doing it <3

Tornado Cash is is a decentralized mixer. It is autonomous code running on Ethereum with no developer that can control it. The fact that it is now illegal to receive funds from autonomous smart contracts throw into question how Web3 will interact develop and interact with the law. I am not sure. Check out this tweet and video below from Zooko, founder of Z Cash.

What can Spinner do about it? Like Tornado, they have created a haven for money launderers. Governments are going to come for Spinner Cash as soon as enough hackers run their coins through it. They will not be able to stop the programme itself from working, of course, but once it is outlawed they can go after anybody putting money into it. Those people are obviously traceable otherwise they wouldn't be using Spinner or Tornado in the first place.

I wouldn't be so sure about that on the IC

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-08-09 13:30:00 UTC | #9

I don't think the government would be able to stop the smart on the IC without assistance from the NNS if the contract is on a large enough subnet that is well distributed. Plus what's stopping the dev from redeploying the dapp over and over, sort of like the spam issue. Am Ithinking about this right?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-09 13:36:30 UTC | #10

The US government has authority in many countries across the world, they can subpoena providers in most first world countries and order them to shut down the canister, which they obviously can't do. Their only option is to shut down the node, which translates in loss of capacity for the whole network and loss of trust on node providers end cause they lost money on an investment.

The dev can keep spamming the contract, but at that point he'd have lost pretty much all users cause who wants to keep liquidity in a canister that might disappear in a matter of days?

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-08-09 13:38:01 UTC | #11

I need to take some time and ponder over this a bit more. I support privacy but there has to be room for some way to implement privacy while complying with KYC policies. Money laundering is a huge problem and Tornado has been the main facilator of it in crypto. It might be time to reframe the problem decentralization is trying to fix. Rather than bypassing sensible regulations, perhaps it should be removing disproprotional power from corporation to users.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-09 13:46:55 UTC | #12

Imo we shouldn't focus too much on this specific case, regardless on what you think about Tornado cash, if a 3rd party has the ability to impact a decentralized system without partaking in the consensus mechanism, then the system isn't that decentralized.

If a centralized entity has authority over what's allowed then you're gambling your views will always align with theirs and the day this stops being the case, you're in for a rough awakening. 

Also as a rule of thumb if the government is trying to take away your privacy and freedom using: terrorism, CP or nazis as an excuse they're most likely fooling you.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-09 14:09:33 UTC | #13

The system itself has not been impacted. The US government has forbidden Americans from interacting with specific addresses associated with Tornado Cash. Since I am not an American, I can still interact with Tornado without fear of punishment. 
Governments will always be able to forbid citizens from transacting with specified entities, irrespective of the technical capabilities of that entity. It does not matter how decentralised that organisation is. Of course, in case of organisations that are insufficiently decentralised, a government can do much more than criminalise interactions with it, it can shut the thing down.
The idea that crypto will be able to act as a means of widespread tax evasion without government sanction is a pipe dream. Besides, unless one believes that taxation is a form of theft or slavery (I do not), many government sanctions are legitimate rather than being attempts to fool the public. If North Korea sponsored hackers are going to target networks like the Ronin network and then spirit away the money through Tornado, it creates a vector of attack for unfree states to undermine relatively free ones. Of course, I would love to anonymise my crypto holdings completely, who wouldn't, but if it also enables really bad actors to do really bad things I would factor in the price of that anonymity.

Yep and that is what should happen, regulate on the app level instead of the protocol, but from past experience I doubt this is what would have happened if Tornado cash were run on the IC.

Let's not kid ourselves bad actors have so many ways to do their shady business, they barely give a damn about cryptos, I'd rather have privacy coin so that people living under dictatorships have more freedom than ban them completely so I can have a false sense of security.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-09 14:42:15 UTC | #16

It's not easy to move millions of dollars around without being traced. The percentages lost in evading sanctions are quite large. As more people understand what is possible with mixers, the amount of money laundered through them will only grow if left unchecked. Also, helping North Korea make money from hacks (estimated at a billion dollars thus far, not small change) only bolsters and stabilises one of the worst dictatorships on earth. I am not a fan of promoting shady business with the excuse that shady people will manage to do shady things anyway.

Like it or not blockchain  is the wild west of the internet and IC like any other authentic blockchain project should just give the middle finger to the US just like it would give the middle finger to Russia, China or Iran.

What sort of jurisdiction does the US govt have with switzerland? I’m under the impression they could come at Dom and he could give them an eloquently articulated “fuck you”, and they could not do anything about it.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-09 19:20:45 UTC | #19

Yeah and then they'd send a subpoena to all the nodes in countries under US jurisdiction (a lot) and have node provider shut down, effectively reducing the network's decentralization and making running a node a very risky investment.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-09 19:25:22 UTC | #20

Couple things fascinating about this. 

1. The smart contract from Tornado Cash still exists! Gov. cannot take it down. So it just says you cannot use it. 

2. Ethereum does not allow folks to reject incoming transfers to your wallet! So if you are ever annoyed you should send some eth to your enemies through Tornado Cash! There's nothing they can do about it and it'll immediately make them targets of the US gov lol. 

3. I agree with a lot of the stuff further up. We need to find a middle ground to comply with KYC and maintain privacy. I have no answers!

Is this true? So web3 means there's no compliance with laws or regulation at all and if there is it isn't web3? I don't know if that's true. I think web3 means that the token holders of the network get to decide what dapps are regulated and not just 1 person or entity (as is the case with AWS).

Yes and no. Even if a dApp is run on many nodes spread across the world as long as they are run in data centers there will be issues. That is because US has jurisdiction over a lot of countries so once they find out the nodes running a dApp they'll subpoena each one of them at that point 3 things can happen:
- the dApp is removed by the NNS or owner
- the node shuts down or is shut down by data center to comply with the subpoena
- NNS decides to move the node to another subnet, so it can keep running and still comply with the demand.

So as you can see no matter what an external centralized entity can influence the protocol. Now the 3rd case would be the most common and preferrable one imo, but it still has downsides: if all nodes under US jurisdiction have to be moved to other subnets, that subnet will less have nodes overall and in fewer countries which reduces the level of decentralization and by having less nodes in usually not very populated countries the UX will suffer due to higher latency.

The only way to solve this issue is having subnets with permissionless nodes, this is one of the cool aspect of IC, with subnets the devs can choose based on their needs, but this perk is barely being used by Dfinity.

Yeah thats exactly what I mean, despite this theoretical possibility of having many types of subnets with varying level of performance and decentralization, we only have 2 types: app and system with the only difference being node count. We don't even know if and how the protocol would work under different performance and security assumptions, e.g permissionless nodes run on home connections with no uptime guarantees and its a topic that barely gets talked about despite being one of the original selling points of Dfinity's chain. Years ago they even talked about letting devs choose the amount of desired replication.

Those things will have to be developed, they cant just flip a switch and turn it on. It would be great if they could develop and deliver every single feature they want within months but that's not reality. The platform will take years to get fully developed.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-09 22:39:25 UTC | #28

Sure but considering they are barely talked about by both Dfinity and the community and Badlands reception wasn't the best due to how it was presented (a separate chain with a different token), it's hard to understand where such upgrades sit on Dfinity's roadmap and whether they are still planned or not. 
A few years ago Dfinity talked a lot about orthogonal persistance and how on the IC you wouldn't have to care about storing data or subnets and stuff like that, now we found out thats not a thing and all the jesus tech like Big Map is nowhere to be seen and isn't even being worked on. Plus some of the proposed short term tasks seem to go against the vision Dom sold of "subnets being transparent to the dev".

Obviously big features take time to build, but if core protocol stuff crucial for DX and decentralization seems to have been forgotten then I feel the need to remind the community, which isn't made only by devs but also non tech people who believe IC runs on "Alien tech", that it's not all sunshine and roses and we are still missing fundamental features needed to make the IC an unmatched rival in the web 3 space.

If this stuff doesn't get prioritized we are in for a rude awakening once BTC integration comes online, with Tornado cash down Spinner might be under the spot light and then I'm afraid of what could happen.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-10 00:28:59 UTC | #29

I think you are being rather harsh on the team building these things. It took ETH four or five years to move from proof of work to proof of stake. And it's a huge institution being backed by people with much more resources than Dfinity. And I'm still not even confident they're going to get it done next month.  

My point is it's only been a year. I like to see them working on immediate issues and core protocol features that is needed right now. However, I am not opposed you lightning a little fire under their butts to get things moving.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-10 00:48:58 UTC | #30

I'm not harsh just being realistic, Dfinity hyped the project promising certain features before launch that are nowhere to be seen and often boast about the chains TPS and speed, but what is that good for if it can be influenced by powerful entities? Anyone can achieve high TPS, the challenge is doing it while solving the trilemma. ETH is slow but at least its decentralized enough the US government can't change the protocol.

[quote="Sormarler, post:29, topic:14768"]

[/quote]

Well guess what better vertical scalability and improvements to data management were the most requested features in the "scalability" WG, better DX and more decentralization are core protocol features needed asap.

I know this stuff takes time to build, but you might understand that if Dfinity extensively talked about how great their chain was going to be due to all these features nowhere to be seen 1 year after launch  and the DX that was initially promised seems to contraddicted by features that are being actively worked on, I can't just watch and wait. I don't want to light a fire under their butts for the sake of it, I'd just like to know whats going on and if their plans have changed over the years and at the same time make sure newcomers know what IC is missing.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-10 00:55:40 UTC | #31

Interesting. So in Ethereum's case they could not take down tornado cash because it is so censorship resistant. They instead had to resort to telling folks not to use it. 

In the IC's case, if they come after the data centers or nodes then we might not have the same luxury... I would assume only Badlands can solve that. Right?

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-10 01:05:24 UTC | #32

Correct, badlands and other features like node rotation, homomorphic encryption and multi party computation are the only way to solve the issue. Otherwise dApps which are illegal in all 1st world countries (possibly due to being against US laws) won't be able to run in data centers hosted there and only nodes in minor countries will be able to host those dApps, resulting in reduced decentralization and worse UX as I said above.

Dfinity plans to solve the issue in the short term by allowing boundary nodes to blacklist controversial canisters, this is a stopgap to protect node operators but doesn't solve the issue cause:
- Atm all boundary nodes are run by Dfinity, so they'll probably share the same policy
- Dfinity stated this:
>Since boundary nodes generally serve specific geographies and jurisdictions, this makes it possible that canisters will be accessible in some places, but not others, depending upon where legal action occurs.

So if you live in the US and all boundary nodes there don't serve a canister it won't be accessible to all US users. I made a post about this months ago if you are interested in the topic: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/decentralization-on-the-ic-moving-forward/11636

Thanks Zane. Appreciate the comprehensive response. I searched through the thread in Decentralization on the IC moving forward and did not see anything from Dfinity. It clearly is top of mind for them though and I am sure they have some thoughts on it given the whole badlands exploration.

Your proposal article really makes me think that whole Mario Nintendo debacle was a massive red herring. It was the wrong debate to have. So long as law enforcement can shut down nodes because they are in data centers and easily located, node providers simply HAVE to comply. All the talk about throwing up the middle finger to the law is stupid if it is a losing fight. Right now, you are correct in that Dfinity is not censorship resistant. Yes it is an open system that is WAY more performant than any other cryptocurrency and a superior alternative to AWS in some respects. But no, it is not censorship resistant because of the dependance on data centers. 

Now, if we want to implement additional subnets to complement the IC that are in fact censorship-resistant and cannot be shut down by law enforcement then that is a debate worth having. But your long well thought out forum post did not get much of a response from Dfinity. Did you ever have any conversations following the thread? I would imagine that to carry out your plan would require significant effort and resources from Dfinity to make it a reality.  

Closing the loop on this thread, if law enforcement really wants to shut down Spinner Cash it seems like it probably could under the current structure of the IC. Right?

Crypto community=

Someone ... "crypto is to hide and launder money"

Government...  "we ban system with the sole purpose of  hiding crypto"
Crypto bro...  " I want my privacy" (oups... transparency gone my magic)

Does this community want to follow the laws or being outlaws? Any of you need spinner cash?  I don't.  Censorship resistant?  Ok, what will you do with child porn, money laundering, drug deals, copyright of hard working people and artist on IC...  and so much more?  Do you want IC to become Dark web3?

Twitter handle, "Cryptoisgood", an ICP fan on Twitter and Tik Tok, have already asked twitter to lock an account that was stealing his content and his identity.  What will he do when, if, IC get fully censorship proof?

It is a bad taste to me that spinner cash won the supernova first prize.   Is this the best we can do?  I am 100% for privacy and hate government spying on citizens with no reasons.  But  i hate more everything else I mentionned in this post.  Which battle are you picking up?

was not worthy of the award....the fact that you don't need this kind of tools for anonymity doesn't mean that other people in this planet don't have good use for it. These applications are just tools like a knife or syringe or many other things that criminals also use to commit crimes.

I have done multiple KYC with banks in the past.  Do you know how much money I have?  What privacy are you talking about?  Does the Internet Identity not private enough?
We can open a IC account and deposit tons of ICP, worth millions without any KYC.  Not good enough?

One thing for sure.  If some important amount of crypto goes through SpinnerCash after some important hacks, I predict the government will ban SpinnerCash just the same.  So whatever we agree or not, the end result may be the same and the community must be prepared for such an event.  This one is not hard to predict.
Swimming against the current of the river is much harder, most of time impossible to reach the destination.  Up to Ic to swim with or against the current of the crypto river.

I don't think people are arguing that is not going to happen. The concern is what the role of the internet computer governance is when it does happen. Should the nns be involved in censoring application that may be illegal in one jurisdiction but not in another? Is the internet censorship resistant enough to allow controversial applications to run on it? If the internet computer is truly a global compute platform, there should be no reason something like spinner can't run on it without interference from the DAO because as far as I know it is not illegal to use privacy tools in many countries. 

On the other hand, I agree with censorship of certain things like CP because that is illegal in every jurisdiction that I know of. 

The community you really need to start talking about Badlands to harden the decentralization of the internet computer.

No bad organisations, just bad people within and we need to allow them to do as they believe for then to fall over and face the consequences.

Great reading as I didn't know anything about SpinnerCash and enjoying the conversation

But your long well thought out forum post did not get much of a response from Dfinity. Did you ever have any conversations following the thread?
[/quote]

Unfortunately I haven't heard anything from Dfinity, which makes me think they don't have any plans to improve the situation in the foreeseable future outside of using boundary nodes as censor, which as they plan to implement completely wouldn't solve the issue and even with changes might not be enough for authorities. Dfinity seem to rely too much on technicalities, they did this for the tax proposals and are betting on it for boundary nodes too. I'm skeptical the authorities will be fine with content not being served in some jurisdictions, imagine if the US knew a Wikileaks server is hosted in the US but only accessible from Switzerland, do you think they'll accept such a situation or do whatever they can to track down the homeland server and get it shut down?.

f law enforcement really wants to shut down Spinner Cash it seems like it probably could under the current structure of the IC. Right?
[/quote]
I believe, they might give it the Tornado cash treatment and on top of it require US nodes operators to stop running its canisters, such sanctions might extend to other countries too due to OFAC/FATF, some might consider such a possibility too unlikely, but I'm not too sure considering one of TC's devs was arrested in the Netherlands.

I thought this was fake news ( I.e the canister owner of the Mario game took it down willingly or it ran out of cycles ) 

I played more emulated games on the IC after the game was removed on a new link which I presume ran out of cycles

It is true that the canister owner took the game down willingly. However, the situation did expose some core issues with the way ICP is handling censorship. For one, the NNS seems to have the ability to remove canisters. The last discussion centered around whether or not the NNS should use that ability based on a DMCA notice served to a boundary node operator. The discussion will be much more serious if boundary node operators (which I believe is still only Dfinity at the moment) are facing OFAC sanctions this time around. 

I personally haven't seen any updates regarding this, but it seems to me like boundary node decentralization should be a high priority right now.

I’m not harsh, just being realistic; Dfinity hyped the project promising certain features before launch that a nowhere to be seen and often boast about the chains TPS and speed, but what is that good for if it can be influenced by powerful entities?
[/quote]

Thankfully we all invest for different reasons and that’s the beauty of democracy. I don’t think ICP should go against US sanctions mostly because I don’t want my investment in the NNS to go to 0. Frankly if ICP truly becomes unstoppable that’s what would happen. The US government would jail everyone at Dfinity and the token would go to 0. I know people are going to say USA doesn’t have jurisdiction in Europe, lots of people work in Dfinity San Francisco and lots of people in Zurich have family in the USA. Even if they don't jail them, the threat is enough to destroy the project. I know if my job labeled me a terrorist, I would quit.

With that said  if a proposal shows up saying US sanctions are asking us to take down spinner cash I will vote yes.

That's funny because you cannot have one without the other if you think deeply about it.
Your ability to improve your 'financial future' is directly related to what the blockchain tech is enabling : decentralization, privacy, ownership etc.
Otherwise you would still be under the boots of the banking system and your financial future would still be crappy.

GLdev | 2022-08-24 12:09:17 UTC | #59

I've written this on discord, but I'll leave it here as well, for posterity.

The way I see it, we have three different cases here:

1. The network, through the NNS, gets to decide what smart contracts run on the platform. Anyone can propose to remove a certain canister, and if they get enough votes the canister gets removed. Democracy and PoS in action. In theory, the stakeholders should be incentivized to want the "good of the network", and vote accordingly.

2. The boundary nodes can (and will) block access to certain URLs (and thus to certain smart contracts / canisters) based on what requests they receive from their respective jurisdictions. There is currently an effort from Dfinity to open the process of hosting a boundary node, and in theory help with this issue. (the worst case here being that certain content won't be accessible from certain jurisdictions). As an additional technical challenge, it's unclear if the end-user will be able to select what boundary node to use.

3. A certain government decides to place a certain service on a certain list. That service becomes so toxic that no-one wants to be associated with that service.

I believe it's fair to talk about 1 & 2, while it would be unfair to blame the network / Dfinity for 3. This is so outside any of our scope (stakeholders, devs, the foundation) that it would be a futile expense of energy. There's nothing we can do against governments that also have the power to enforce their rules. The network is irrelevant in this scenario (case in point, the first service was hosted on ETH, a mass distributed network).

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-24 20:23:01 UTC | #60

A major takeaway from the Tornado Cash issue which is particularly relevant to the IC is that while more than one government has come down with a heavy hand on TC and even individual developers of TC, absolutely no moves have been made against the host network Ethereum.
It is imperative that the SNS and NNS be designed in such a way that no contagion from individual apps infects the entire network. Because there are bound to be individual apps that breach jurisdicitional rules and are shut down by various nations. Of course, there should be an ongoing attempt to make the IC genuinely censorship-resistant, but as I see it that seems at least two years away, while the wave of legally questionable services will be on offer on the network much sooner.
While the network is not censorship resistant in any meaningful way, it cannot be stressed enough how important it is for Dfinity and the IC to maintain sufficient distance from individual dapps. The consequences of contagion could be fatal. A few people made a similar point during the Mario debate, I hope the Dfinity foundation takes the issue seriously.

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-08-24 20:51:07 UTC | #61

There's a situation that no one seems to be discussing in this thread

1. A canister has not been taken down by the NNS
2. Http access has been restricted by a BN complying to a takedown request

In this scenario, the canister still has a `http_request` method available. Anyone can run their own frontend for the canister, playing DNS whack-a-mole with whichever government, even after the BN takedown is issued.

Ease of access may be limited, and governments can still create consequences for using a service, but the content and functionality of a canister can only be shut down by the NNS.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-08-24 22:49:54 UTC | #62

That's great. As the IC grows and the number of name neurons increase I'm sure it will be difficult to convince more than 50% of voting power to remove a canister unless we're talking about egregious things like CP. We need to go much better than this. The protocol need to be hard coded that it requires 65% or more vote cast from a proposal to remove a canister. It should be as hard as changing the United States Constitution.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-08-25 03:13:07 UTC | #63

As far as I know, Dfinity operates all boundary nodes and there is no clarity on when this will change. How does the whack-a-mole method work in this reality? Can't the US just tell Dfinity to remove access through *all* boundary nodes and if Dfinity fails to comply, come after Dfinity itself?

1) how can we contact the canister if its not served by any boundary node?

2) If the canister is still reachable, wouldn't authorities reauest a takedown to the node provider running it?

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2022-08-25 15:52:29 UTC | #65

the BN API's are distinct from the http handling logic. The http handling logic will remove <canisterId>.ic0.app, but requests to `/api/v2/<canisterid>` are unaffected by takedown requests.

The Node provider doesn't have the authority or the ability to take down a canister, or to opt out of hosting any particular canister at this point.

@tsetse This work is underway - we've been migrating bare metal boundary nodes to a VM-based model, and monitoring for stability. The goal is to decentralize the operation of boundary nodes soon, but I won't do something irresponsible like promising a date

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-25 17:13:13 UTC | #66

Forgive me if this has been brought up in the thread.

I have an interesting thought experiment that may help to poke holes in some moral/legal/logical arguments about censorship.

What would we do if there were a dangerous canister causing serious harm to the IC itself? Let's say this canister was extremely well-funded and very effective at causing havoc in various ways.

Would we censor it?

I'm aware, but I doubt similar technicalities would be enough for authorities. Also in case a canister were blacklisted by all boundary nodes, would only incoming http request be blocked? Would the canister still be able to perform http requests?

How would this canister harm the IC? By exposing node providers to legal issues or by abusing some vulnerability?

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-26 15:57:20 UTC | #69

Any of those things, or dos attacks of some kind

-------------------------

janosroden | 2022-09-04 08:30:36 UTC | #70

Of course, I’d vote to take it down because I care my interest, the long term success of ic.

However I don’t think anybody would be able to permanently block a service, technically always can be redeployed. For example if I sell weapons I can advertise the url in a closed group but if the url leaks I start using my predeployed secondary url. Another identity, obfuscated wasm and mutated interface.

The key is the anonimity. Until people behind the service not taken down by the police they will run the service. But hey, it’s same with aws except to use aws for illegal things you have to anonimize yourself somehow. 

So I agree to emphasize the difference between dfinity, ic and dapps.

Zane | 2022-09-12 18:27:44 UTC | #72

If the canister negatively impacts the network by dos attacks or abusing some exploits then it should be removed, if it causes legal issues then it's a case to case basis: CP? remove it, Tornado cash like situation? That is a protocol shortcoming and I'd vote against the canister removal. That's the way I see it.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-09-13 12:27:01 UTC | #73

So you see canister censorship as desirable in some circumstances? I know there are some that seem to believe that no censorship should be possible.

-------------------------

Azat | 2022-09-14 12:53:29 UTC | #74

Society is based on the principle:
- Everything that is not forbidden is allowed.

The ban on censorship is too big a ban.
It is necessary to start with small prohibitions. Then combine them into larger ones.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-09-14 15:28:47 UTC | #75

While I understand that sentiment I don't think it's achievable on the IC considering the compromises Dfinity made for scalability's sake and while I can see the appeal of an immutable and completely uncensorable ledger it could facilitate some use undesirable cases.

The problem with having the possibility to censor is it could become a slippery slope, everyone has a different morality compass, some stakers are OG cypherpunks, others only care about their financial investment, in order to make things as clear as possible for dApp devs looking to build on the IC we should do 2 things:

- Make sure the protocol is as shielded as possible from outside influences, e.g authorities threatening node providers

- Figure out guidelines for what is and isn't allowed on the IC, so devs don't get ugly surprises.

Personally speaking I'd only ban canisters which intentionally attack the network with exploits and canisters hosting content usually found on the Deep Web, e.g CP, guns, drugs, etc..., the reason being both are immediately recognizable once spotted and undermining to society.

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-09-15 22:34:03 UTC | #76

Your second item @Zane is relatively easy to do and urgent. NNS needs some sort of constitution asap.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-09-16 04:35:45 UTC | #77

If there are guidelines or a constitution, the IC becomes liable for content on the chain. A blockchain should never have content-related policies. The best path is the exact opposite, to have a completely hands-off approach to dapps and whatever is on them. Because the IC differs from other chains in its ability to host content easily, achieving separation is difficult, but the need for separation is more urgent for exactly that reason.

-------------------------

Azat | 2022-09-16 10:24:21 UTC | #79

What you listed is:
 - Defensiveness
 - Law
The executive branch must be added to this list. For example, the NNS will block the canister and in an hour the same new one will appear, how to stop it?

-------------------------

MillionMiles | 2022-09-16 10:37:21 UTC | #80

I think with the current decentralization of IC nodes (a significant percentage of nodes are located in US), it is difficult for Spinner to avoid not being controlled by the US government

Only when there are enough nodes and nodes are entered without permission, the risk of being regulated is greatly reduced
