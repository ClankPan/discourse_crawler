Does anybody know if there currently is an easy interface that can be used to manage cycles for a canister?

What i did was make my NNS principal a controller of all my canisters. Then i linked those canisters in my nns.ic0.app wallet. That allows me to view and add cycles to those canisters from the nns frontend app. It doesnâ€™t allow me to send cycles from the nns front end tho.
