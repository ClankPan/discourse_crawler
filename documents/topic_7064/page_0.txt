I have returned from a bike ride and am back at my keyboard, so I can share the third post about Candid:

https://www.joachim-breitner.de/blog/784-A_Candid_explainer__Opt_is_special

Here I explain the problem with extending records in argument position, and how we came up with some special rules around the `opt` type that solves that problem.

This solution was the conclusion after a two year saga where we considered and dismissed a dozen different solutions (all [summarized here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/issues/1523), if you like reading up on old discussions). It’s not perfect, but it’s the best one we found so far.
