COE project status report in the implementation and operational stage in the real and traditional market.
FOOD COE started its activity in the traditional market without holding an opening ceremony. We spent the first days very hard, with no customers and financial losses every day due to food spoilage.

After the first week, we started producing content on the Instagram social network. We informed our target community on the social network that, as the first traditional business in our country, we are integrating a traditional business with a token structure in the world of digital currencies. After hearing this news, the community supported my social network and we rejected the activity of 3000 targeted followers in less than a month.

In the first step of opening FOOD COE, our production capacity and sales target was an average of 20 complete sandwiches per day. We quickly approached the target and the number of customers increased every day.

The satisfaction of a delightful taste of food as well as the use of new creativity in a local business was the reason for the community's support of FOOD COE.
We activated the online sales line for sandwiches. Achieving the daily target of 20 complete sandwiches was the target planned for the second month, but we achieved this target in the third week of operation.

It is predicted that we can target 40 sandwiches per day in the second month.

<h2>From 100 customers in person, several customer club memberships</h2>

Less than 10% of customers complete their membership in the customer club. After purchasing and entering their contact number in the number collection device, customers in person take a photo of their sandwich and purchase invoice and send it to FOOD COE's Instagram. In the next step, customers will see an educational content to learn how to buy a bag with the Google browser. Make ICPswap money and view NFT in your wallet.
FOOD COE stores 10% of its financial input on a daily basis, converts the stored part into ICP every few days, and at the end of every 30 working days, the collected ICPs are converted into COE tokens through the BABYAROF/COE trading pair. converts

In the coming days, the first reward for the customer club will be done with the help of the ICPswap claim option. We predict that the deposit of the first reward can increase the verbal advertising of customers and members of the customer club, and finally, in the second month, FOOD COE can reach the intermediate target of 20 full sandwiches a day.

Apart from our native accounting software, all financial data is archived in Google Sheets to be available as an open source to the community of Buyers Club members.
**We will soon review the data in a more comprehensive article and share a short-term roadmap.**
