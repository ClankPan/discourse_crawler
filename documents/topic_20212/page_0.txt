One of the cool things about my project [Juno](https://juno.build) is its consistent pattern. Regardless of the project or frontend JavaScript technology, it's always the same library and API, ensuring fast and efficient development.

To showcase this and assist others in getting started, I've now published tutorials for all three major frontend frameworks.

- React ðŸ‘‰ [https://juno.build/blog/build-a-web3-app-with-react-js](https://juno.build/blog/build-a-web3-app-with-react-js)
- Angular ðŸ‘‰ [https://juno.build/blog/develop-an-angular-app-on-blockchain](https://juno.build/blog/develop-an-angular-app-on-blockchain)
- Vue ðŸ‘‰ [https://juno.build/blog/build-a-web3-app-with-vuejs](https://juno.build/blog/build-a-web3-app-with-vuejs)
