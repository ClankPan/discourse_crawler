As you may know we are rewriting the frontend of NNS dapp (related [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/network-nervous-system-dapp-is-moving-to-svelte/11668) for more details).

Today is for me a particular important milestone as  the new version of the NNS dapp that has been deployed introduces all proposals' features rewritten in Svelte. As of this version, the "Voting" tab and the detail page related to the proposals are now served with the new app ([repo](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/tree/main/frontend/svelte)) that lives next to the Flutter app.

I hope you will share my enthusiasm and let me know if you have questions or observations.

P.S.: While releasing we noticed a couple of minor issues we directly solved. We aim to propose these fix and improvements within next few days (related PR are [#698](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/698), [#690](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/690) and [#697](https://github.com/dfinity/nns-dapp/pull/697))

That's a good news 🥳
The voting tab was one of the pain points, now it feels smooth and snappy, great work 🚀
