Having trouble logging in, (I can log in fine on my phone, which is where I originally created the identity). I added my Mac via Chrome to my internet identity and when I try and put in my internet identity it just hangs with the little robot swinging back and forth. I tried restarting Chrome and my computer. I also manually allowed pop-ups for the identity.ic0.app/#authorize webpage directly. 

Any suggestions?

Figured it out! You have to use safari or figure out how to get google chrome to enable finger print scans. Long story short. Use safari.

Google Chrome authorization does not seem to work. I am thinking there is potentially a collision with the icloud keychain where the Internet Identity is seeing that I am on a device signed in with the same icloud account and cant reason out that I am on chrome or tell me the error.
