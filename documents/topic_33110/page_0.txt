Spotted a "deadlink" in SNS.yaml:

```
  # For more information, please refer to
  # https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Network_Nervous_System#Proposal_decision_and_wait-for-quiet
  #
  # This field is specified as a duration. For example: "1 day".
  maximum_wait_for_quiet_deadline_extension: 1 day
```

Not "dead" per s√© but [https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Network_Nervous_System#Proposal_decision_and_wait-for-quiet](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Network_Nervous_System#Proposal_decision_and_wait-for-quiet) leads to a page of the Wiki that redirects to the IC portal NNS topic without any particular destination - i.e. [https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/daos/nns/overview).

I think it would user friendly to provide a link that points to the exact location of the topic - or not link.

Thank you for pointing this out. The wiki page changed to https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/NNS_Canisters#Proposal_decision_and_wait-for-quiet. I'll create a PR now to update that.

We are slowly migrating the NNS docs to the ICP docs so we'll eventually refer to the docs instead of wiki pages. :)
