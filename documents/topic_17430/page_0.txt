As a noob user, I'm wondering if it'll ever be possible to host a Discourse forum on the IC? Or even host a WordPress blog on-chain as well? I personally would love to be able to do these things as I have both my own forum and blog, and would love to have both of them on-chain, but I'm guessing this isn't possible? 

And no, I know there's some IC alternatives, but I'm sure many people would rather stick with what they're familiar with, plus, it's very established and gives many customization options.

Existing software is a bit tough because you need 1. A vm that can run the code and 2. Rearchitect any long running functions that could hit the cycle limit 2. Abstract a file system into the vm.

We may get there, but we have a long way to go.
