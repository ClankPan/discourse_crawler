ICPCoins ->  How does the DAO work? I have serious doubts if it really is a DAO...

It looks like FranHefner is pointing out a potential issue with the execution and listing process of proposals in the DAO. Specifically, Proposal 41: "Add Rosetta ($ROS) To ICPCoins" was executed but not listed on the web, which raises questions about the effectiveness and transparency of the DAO.

Maybe it‚Äôs worth looking into whether there was a technical error or an oversight. This situation could be a good opportunity for the community and the developers to review and possibly improve the proposal implementation process. Transparent communication from the developers could really help clear up any confusion.

I believe that the developers should only execute what the DAO decides. Otherwise, we are just pretending to be a DAO. There may be technical issues, but they have never communicated this. It should be made public if a proposal couldn't be executed due to technical reasons. Additionally, the ROS token is ICRC1 like most tokens, so I don't think it's a technical issue.

On another note, another proposal was executed without closing the voting stage, which is also not correct.
