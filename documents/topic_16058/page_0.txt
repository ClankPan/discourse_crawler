*I posted this on Twitter, but thought Id ask here to see what kind of answers I got:*

*Thanks!*

As an entrepreneur from LATAM, I got interested in crypto because I like enabling people outside major tech hubs to be founders. What businesses have people seen that make $100-$1K per month in #ICP or other chains? Im more interested in millions having incomes than 1-2 unicorns.

I am also interested what is inhibiting these businesses from existing... and seeing what I can do to help.

Fwiw, I am less interested in answers that are:

* crypto arbitrage
* dropping NFTs
* yield farming

Not because they are bad, but because I feel OTHER businesses get less attention.

Community management, Astro turfing, web design specifically for meme coins. 

All profitable businesses Iâ€™ve seen are support businesses to launch a crypto project.
