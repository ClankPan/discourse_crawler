Yeah, when will the IC be a DNS resolver we can point to? That might work

But this domain was throwing errors for our users on their browsers.. 
therefore we switched everyone back to raw.ic0.app.

What do you do about canisters that are created that need to be raw.. but are new?

We are currently designing a scheme that allows *any* canister on the Internet Computer to use the ICP hardware wallet app for securely displaying and signing transactions, and that would work as follows:

* The canister developer specifies for each pair of (canister id, method name) a schema for rendering the parameters. That would likely be a transaction name and a structure that specifies for each field of the Candid argument whether it should be displayed and the title that should be used. (We need to devise a format for this, this actually is the main open design task.)
* The canister then signs said schema with the IC’s threshold ECDSA signature method.
* The dapp front end sends the unsigned transaction along with the signed schema to the hardware wallet.
* The hardware wallet derives the canister’s ECDSA public key from the IC’s ECDSA root public key and the canister id, and verifies the signature on the schema. It then uses the schema to display the transaction to the user, and signs the transaction when the user approves.

Hi @bjoern, hope this message finds you well. Any ETA of this wonderful feature ?

Yubico recovery should be implemented securely this needs to be worked on ASAP

It's unfair that we will be unable to recover our accounts and are being forced to use insecure seedphrases 

Literally what's the point in setting up a Yubico recovery if it's useless in emergency scenarios

Sadly it's a browser limitation in the WebAuthn spec, there isn't any way to work around that as far as I know. It's basically scoped to the domain to prevent phishing, but that also means you're out of luck when the domain is no longer there :/

Only workaround I can think of would be an app/cli tool to register and use the yubico key outside the webbrowser (the tool would basically use the same canister methods but its not tied to a domain).

Sorry you say this works but you can't delete recovery phrases anymore ( correct me if I am wrong please )

Is a migration path still being worked on for the new link or should we just set up manually

-------------------------

Hey @memetics, quite some time has passed when I confirmed this, but you are right that it is no longer possible to delete the passphrase.

Watching this post and still not possible to move my neuron to a ledger, excuse me but Why is taking this so long. I didn’t know you couldn’t move your neuron to a ledger after creating the internet identiy, i didnt even know you couldn’t remove a seed phrase and put the ledger.


Also Incredible thing, reading another concern about the “ ephemeral keys “ so it’s the same thing if i use a yubikey ? These private key can still be extracted ??
