It is almost time to hand the Catalyze (https://aqs24-xaaaa-aaaal-qbbea-cai.ic0.app) platform over to its community by becoming an SNS-DAO. As the proposal to start the decentralized sale is coming soon we believe it is the right time to open the democratic process and get community members involved.

Please feel free to use this forum post to ask all of your questions to the team working on Catalyze.

The Catalyze platform

Catalyze is an innovative social application designed to run on the Internet Computer. The app serves as a community organizing tool and a social application on Web3 where you can build groups, interact with other members of your community, create/run events, and transact using your Web3 identity and wallet.

Catalyze currently has a suite of organizational tools, including calendar and events planning, tasks, chat, and community groups integrated into the application. As an end-user, you can log into the app using your Web3 internet identity or Web2 credentials.

Here is the link to Catalyze’s white paper (https://catalyze.one/sns-white-paper/) for a more detailed description of what the platform is about and what the vision is for the future.

Decentralization sale details

* Min participation: 1 ICP
* Max participation: 150,000 ICP
* Max to be raised: 1,300,000 ICP
* Min to be raised: 650,000 ICP
* From Community Fund: 400,000 ICP
* Min participants: 125

More details on the sale can be found in the white paper (https://catalyze.one/sns-white-paper/).  

We have successfully completed our SNS code audit with https://beosin.com/ and will be posting the results in a reply to this post later this week.  Once post we will move the remaining code repos to join the rest of our currently open source Github repo.  

Lastly, you can also find the team on Catalyze by joining the Catalyze SNS Feedback group (https://aqs24-xaaaa-aaaal-qbbea-cai.ic0.app/groups/rjpzz-lqkmn-qxiz3-soaaa-aaaaa-fia5q-ibaea-aaaiw)

Let’s do this all together!

"Beosin is a leading global blockchain security brand co-founded by several professors from world-renowned universities. The team consists of 100+ security experts with 40+ PhDs and postdocs."

Looking forward to the report since I couldn't find anything related to the IC.

Can you tell us how the "From Community Fund: 400,000 ICP" is calculated? This is more than 50% of the soft cap. Is there any reason why your project should have a higher CF percentage than the others?

-------------------------

slq016 | 2023-06-28 09:13:05 UTC | #4

cool project ,i will buy 10icp .

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-06-28 17:03:19 UTC | #5

Great question.  We set the CF level based on achieving a raise closer to the Max vs the Soft Cap.  But you raise a good point.  We expected this element to get some good feedback and will take that to heart as we vet this paper with the community.  We can revisit the floor level to improve ratio, as example, or make adjustments to the CF level.  We wanted to find a good balance between proper funding (to build something amazing for the IC community) and not stressing individual ICP investors who are dealing with a volatile market.

As far as I understand - those who participated in the CrowdFund NFT sale 7-8 months ago will receive tokens in proportion to the invested funds.
1. Will there be any advantages for early investors?
2. Will Tier 3 NFT holders get a limited run NFT and access to a NFT gated community on Catalyze as originally promised?

-------------------------

jwarner | 2023-06-29 03:48:32 UTC | #8

Quick question before diving in. Will you be geo blocking U.S. addresses?

Edit: I attempted to log in using my II on Safari, but when the screen came up to create a username, I am not able to view the terms and conditions. Clicking on it does nothing for me and I turned off all blockers. Is there a way for me to view those terms and conditions prior to signing up using another method?

I submitted a bug report through your feedback link.

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-06-29 12:32:35 UTC | #9

We will be doing special airdrops for early supporters post SNS and we are working some additional benefits for NFT CF holders.  Stay tuned.

Yes there will be a special NFT gated community for NFT CF token holders.   During the spring we developed the back end for both NFT and Neuron gated communities.   We actually have been beta testing the NFT gated communities in production for a few months.   

During this time we decided the whole Catalyze UI needed a redo and we hired a top flight design firm to rework the UI and UX.  That UI is being coded out as we speak.

By doing this we can offer the promised NFT gated community features we planned but with a more elegant and approachable UI/UX.  

We debated firing up the NFT community for our CF NFT holders but when we saw the new UI we decided to wait until we got closer to SNS.  

We also are developing something called Catalyze Casts which are akin to Twitter Spaces.  Casts will be a key feature for the NFT CF Token and Neuron holders to have the fireside chats with the Catalyze team we envision during the CF back in November.    Casts will of course be available to all users and groups in Catalyze.  

We cannot wait to release those for our valued NFT crowdfund holders and the broader Catalyze community!

Thanks for the comprehensive answer and good luck as the project looks really promising.

ZackDS | 2023-06-29 13:23:20 UTC | #12

Saw on twitter that the audit was done for a while now, are you translating it to English or removing the bad parts before posting it ? Thank you

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-06-29 16:04:51 UTC | #13

Its a failed project; Bad Product with no real users and user engagement. Its only happen in IC where useless projects are welcoming to raise funds. 
400K ICP from CF is Looting our valuable community resource..

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-06-29 17:06:21 UTC | #14

Anony, In your opinion should the community fund only invest in mature products with no growth outlook? Thanks, I’m eager to read your thoughts.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-06-30 04:32:55 UTC | #15

Hi DHemingway,
I didn't say anything about product maturity. To be honest i don't see any value proposition or competitive advantages on this product. In addition to this I have used this platform and it seems that no actual user engagement like the team claimed.

Hello @rlaracue, the link to the whitepaper seems broken (though it can easily be found on the website following the same link)

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-07-01 16:27:01 UTC | #18

They web dev team was messing links.  Sorry about that.  

Here is the WP link from the newly launched Catalyze site. https://catalyze.one/whitepaper/

BTW we are working on a promo video showing the new Catalyze (v2) that is coming.   This will give people noodling on voting or buying tokens some extra context on where we are headed.  Catalyze 1.0 was an alpha/beta with an MVP UI that was out there longer than expected given the bear market and all the lovely post FTX/SEC drama.   

We hope you will be excited about where Catalyze is going and your roles in curating that journey as SNS neuron holders/advisors.

jwarner | 2023-07-01 19:30:27 UTC | #19

@rlaracue Will you be geoblocking US users and do you have a link to your Terms and Conditions for creating an account?

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-07-01 19:53:58 UTC | #20

We are discussing it with our legal council atm.   T&Cs will come from that discussion.  

Our goal is to establish the DAO in Switzerland and we are also having discussions about moving our company there as well (or at least to Europe).  The company move to EMEA will happen at a later date vs the DAO which is more immediate.

I will post back here once we get a final call on geofencing etc.  Thank you for a great question!

Be well.  
R.

devabcd | 2023-07-02 02:03:28 UTC | #21

Are there any web3 projects from other chains that are in the process or have committed to on-boarding to catalyze? Any exclusivity agreements; meaning they will abandon discord.

-------------------------

Antony | 2023-07-03 15:33:58 UTC | #22

its been 3 days and no reply to my last comment.

Why Dfinity team is not engaging with this proposal. I think they are not interested in this project.

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-07-03 16:44:18 UTC | #23

Holiday weekend here in the US so we are just getting back online.  We have worked with the Dfinity tokenomics team since later December on this white paper and SNS plan.   They have been great at giving input and have been supportive of us using SNS this year.  They are letting the community ask questions etc at this point.

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-07-03 16:49:28 UTC | #24

We are working with several projects on the IC especially because our current chat engine is compatible with Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack.   We have Discord groups (from the IC) with over 15K members with real time access to Catalyze chat rooms via Discord clients.  We have been testing that feature for 6 mos. 

As we raise SNS we can expand our business development across the IC and into other chains.   We think Catalyze can be a platform to bring other ecosystem users into the fold but having the funding to do those reach outs is part of the going forward plan.  

Thanks!

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-07-03 18:39:59 UTC | #25

From a user perspective what did you think of the platform? Without factoring your sentiment on # of users.

Integration with Discord sounds promising. Maybe some kind of integration with a Microsoft Word or Excel type of product on the platform and a video chat and some other stuff it could be a cool business product. 
Might also be a spot for businesses to collaborate & create enterprise level software or dapps etc., I don’t think what Catalyze is today will be the Catalyze that is tomorrow. 
#1 rule in business is change and because of AI the world will need more thinkers and less workers, maybe businesses or groups will need Catalyze to be a hub for AI. That seems like a logical path to me. 
Speaking of AI and the fact we will need less worker mindset and more thinker mindset, AI will need to play a critical role in redeveloping our children’s education. There is so much opportunity here. It’s mind blowing. Anyway - just my thoughts cheers and happy 4th of July mate!

You can take comfort in the fact that it was taken to heart.

DHemingway | 2023-08-11 19:40:53 UTC | #33

Last hour question… I’m confused, what’s the marketing plan? 

It looks like you have incentives for users (I love that approach) - but this implies that some how or way these users found their way to Catalyze.

Any partnerships with other pre-SNS projects or specific “hot & trending” verticals like AI or other cryptocurrencies?
Discord a Web2 business has never to my knowledge and will never be profitable, it’s a money pit where as an investor you hope for a higher valuation on the next raise to inflate your current investment - why is Catalyze different? 
Is 18-24 months enough time to acquire enough users?

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-08-15 17:14:31 UTC | #34

Hi Catalyze, I see you weren’t able to answer my question during the previous SNS sale, if you have some time to get back to me I’d appreciate it. Thanks.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-08-15 17:41:42 UTC | #35

Before/after creating SNS canisters, I recommend that you first answer any questions/concerns of the community and let your investors understand that it is a mistake to invest at the last minute in a project that you want to support.

-------------------------

rlaracue | 2023-08-15 19:18:40 UTC | #36

Hey sorry we didn't get to this earlier.   

Until now we have been a engineering oriented project and like most blockchain start ups we have focused on development and leveraging Twitter and other social platforms for outreach.   

While those approaches worked in the last bull run we feel more traditional marketing strategies need to be combined with web3 models.  By hiring a marketing lead we can begin our transition to a hybrid and KPI driven marketing programs.  That lead will craft our marketing and user acquisition strategy.   We will report on that plan to the DAO & community at large once the person is on-boarded.

As stated above, marketing will start with bringing on an accomplished marketing lead (web2 & web3) in addition to a Community/Brand Ambassador Lead.  The marketing person will lead brand development, advertising, PR, user acquisition, and will manage a set of user personas so we can target our marketing and application strategies around real world use cases.  

The Community Lead will be responsible in-part for launching a Catalyze ambassador program and will work with our partner ModClub with providing guidance, people, and tools for Catalyze community moderation.  

Working with the Marketing Lead this role will own the Catalyze landing page, in-platform events, promotions, and the like.  This person will also be educating the community on our tokenomics model, token use cases, and token grant program.  They will be the voice of the users/community managers back into the leadership team.  We expect this role will have a few directs in time as will be the case for marketing as they deliver results to the DAO.

**Other Thoughts.**

I can say doing target marketing videos (showcasing key features in real work use cases), training/education AMAs, blogging about how to come out of the bear marketing as a community/community leader, ads, should be part of our outreach.  

For example we can bridge Catalyze chat to most major chat apps (Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp) but that fact is not well known even within the IC.  A marketing program targeting transitioning from web2 to web3 without losing your 14K Telegram channel (as an example) is needed.  

In addition we need to focus on value propositions that go beyond Catalyze and market the IC overall.  

We need to attract users from other chains and from Web2 into the IC.  We plan on supporting Eth and ckEth.    The latter by supporting ckEth in Catalyze and also Solidity based app add-ons to Catalyze.   Think Slack app marketplace for IC and Eth based mini dapps.  We already support ckBTC but plan to do more outreach in the BTC community later this year.

We also have some web3 gaming partnerships that are being negotiated and we hope to share some of those when we can.  

Building tools is cool but helping people navigate what comes next, how to succeed at building lasting & self directed communities vs audiences will be as important as cool tech for attracting users.

Given I am former Gartner Research VP and our COO Johann Hartmann is a former WEF (and NHL) community leader/writer we will be working with a writing team to help bridge the divide between cool tech and practical "how to" and best practice content mined from the communities.  We will be working closely with our partner Nuance to create and publish that content.

Lastly, while we have been working towards SNS we have also invested a significant about of capital and time redesigning and reskinning Catalyze.   What is out there today is an MVP with an MVP UI that needs to be retired.  I see the comments.  :) 

What is coming is a more polished, easier to navigate, and more useful application that is more of a representation of what we wanted Catalyze to be from the start.  This transition will usher in great browser experience (desktop and finally mobile!).  That update will be followed by native clients for IOS, Android and then MacOS and Windows desktop clients.  

These are some of the many reasons and initiatives that a successful SNS will enable.

**How will all this play out or be decided?**

We will conduct Town Halls post-SNS to discuss these programs and ideas before they get submitted as proposals.   

We need to remember that anything we do post SNS will be community driven and proposal based.  In addition to the ideas shared here we expect our community of SNS token holders will have ideas, programs, and approaches they can offer up as proposals or informally.  That is the power of the DAO.  Many minds working on solving the same challenges, together. 

It is an area we take quite seriously and will be making it a key focal area post SNS.   Thanks for the question.

In Catalyze’s resubmitted SNS proposal, it blames technical issues for not raising the funds to hit its minimum threshold.

What are these technical issues? Are they on Catalyze or DFINITY’s side?

[Proposal reference](https://nns.ic0.app/proposal/?proposal=124264)

> “Why a new proposal? In light of recent developments, Catalyze is resubmitting a proposal for decentralization to the SNS, driven by a commitment to transparency and inclusivity. The previous SNS campaign encountered unforeseen technical challenges resulting in major investors being locked out of the system right at the end of the process, which prevented equitable participation. Acknowledging the significance of decentralized decision-making and our responsibility to ensure equal access, we are taking proactive measures to rectify the situation. Our renewed proposal aims to rectify the technical issue, guaranteeing the full engagement of all stakeholders and reaffirming our dedication to fostering an open and democratic ecosystem within the SNS framework.”

Specifically, how were “major” investors locked out for a whole week?
