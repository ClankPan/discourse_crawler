# Goal

As a community, revise the current governance voting rewards system to disincentivize proposal spamming for profit, while still incentivizing voter participation and allowing anyone to easily submit an NNS proposal (no censorship).

# Motivation

Over the past week, a flurry of governance proposals have spammed the NNS in order to take advantage of an [increase in rewards from voting on governance proposals](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/changes-to-governance-proposals-and-voting-reward-weights-proposal/9172/64), which was changed earlier this year.

Here is a list of those proposals:

- [3.2 Let us get to know NNS again.双语](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/53056)

This isn't the fault of the person creating these proposals - it simply demonstrates a flaw in the governance rewards system and should be remedied ASAP (given adequate time for community discussion and input) to stabilize the rate at which rewards are disbursed from the NNS.

# Potential Solutions

Here are a few rough solutions that I have come up with, but **I welcome the community to add to, expand upon, and rip apart each of these ideas**. Each idea aims to remove financial incentives to creating NNS proposals, while retaining governance voting incentives and limiting any barriers to creating proposals (protecting NNS proposal censorship).

### 1. Fix governance voting rewards on a per time period (week, month, etc.) basis

The idea here is that regardless of the number of governance proposals submitted, the voters are rewarded for their participation divided by the number of proposals submitted in the time period, and these proposals are disbursed at the end of the time period to ensure the correct voting reward per vote cast, and that no vote on a single proposal is worth more than any other proposal with that time period. 

If the NNS receives 1 or 1000 proposals within a time period, a participant that votes on all proposals will receive the same voting rewards. The governance rewards paid out over time will therefore be predictable and stable, and the fixed governance rewards will remove an financial incentives or potential conflicts of interest in creating an NNS proposal.

The community can decide how to handle the case where 0 proposals are submitted in a time period, as there are many different ways to handle this.

### 2. Governance voting rewards decrease by a factor on a per time period basis

This idea is similar to **1**, except governance voting rewards are no longer fixed within the chosen time period. 

After each proposal is created within the time period, the amount of rewards disbursed decreases by an agreed upon factor (1/2, etc.). This allows rewards to be paid out after each proposal instead of waiting until the end of the time period, but means that some governance proposals would have greater rewards than others. While a strong financial incentive remains in creating governance proposals and participating in voting, this incentive drops off depending on the rate at which the governance voting rewards decrease.

### 3. Governance Proposals have a minimum week-long incubation time before going live, and governance voting rewards are fixed on a weekly basis 

This idea builds off of **1**, in that weekly governance voting rewards are fixed and therefore predictable, but adds a minimum incubation time during which the proposal is locked to voting, but visible to all NNS users. After the incubation period, the proposal goes live and is unlocked, allowing voting. The incubation period gives the community the necessary time to review and discuss a proposal before it goes live, and allows a submitter to withdraw and revise the proposal if they would like to do so.

The general timeline would look like this:

1.  An NNS user submits a governance proposal to the NNS. **This proposal is available for viewing, but locked to any voting**.
2.  (recommended, but optional) The NNS user creates a post on the Developer forum/IC community channels outlining their proposal and inviting discussion. They can choose to do this before or after step 1 (submitting their proposal to the NNS).
3. **Every Sunday, proposals submitted between 1-2 weeks prior (between 2 Sundays ago, and the previous Sunday) unlock and are live for voting.** 
4. The proposals submitted the prior week (between that Sunday and the previous Sunday) are queued up and available for viewing in the NNS (but still locked), such that a voter will be able to view and understand which proposals will unlock and go live the next Sunday.
5. The process repeats each week.


While more complicated, this approach has several benefits over **1** and **2**.
- Voting rewards remain predictable while allowing immediate voting reward payout, as the NNS knows how many proposals will be live in a given week, and can therefore determine the total voting rewards for a given proposal.
- The incubation period allows NNS voters time to reflect, discuss, and potentially improve governance proposals
- The incubation period allows NNS users to do their due diligence on a proposal and bring up any flaws or issues with it, helping protect the community against a flawed or malicious proposal from reaching the NNS without opportunity for oversight
- Proposals submitted during a given week will all be queued for viewing together (step 4), and will go live/unlock together (step 3), meaning that NNS users will be able to predict and schedule adequate time for both reviewing a proposal and voting on that proposal if they choose to do so. This could potentially allow more NNS users the time to manually cast votes, instead of needing to follow neurons due to a lack of time.

Going forward we will need a way to quality control proposals. Maybe it’s time to think about implementing representative democracy type system. Where a few representative we voted for are paid to read and sponsor bills.

-------------------------

ArjaanBuijk | 2022-04-05 03:06:50 UTC | #3

I love the idea of an incubation period.

I like to propose an idea that mimics the process of having to gather a number of signatures before a proposal can be entered.

During the period a proposal is locked, a certain number of neurons must vote to unlock it. Neurons can not vote to keep it locked, but only vote to unlock it.

If a locked proposal does not receive sufficient signatures, ie. unlock votes, the proposal never gets unlocked and is deleted.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-05 15:59:52 UTC | #4

This is a great addition! 

A pro of this approach is that it ensures that unpopular or opaque proposals will most likely never reach the voting floor. I see this as very similar to propositions needing a minimum # of signatures to get on a state ballot.

A con of this approach is that it does complicate the voting process somewhat, and make it more involved.

Would be curious what the NNS team has to say about this in terms of how difficult it might be to implement @jwiegley, in addition to the solution **3** described in the original post.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-04-05 18:00:08 UTC | #5

I'm not clear yet on how adding a 1 week no-voting period at the beginning of the proposal cycle helps. For those who want to use spam as a way of advertising to the neuron holder community, this just gives them an extra week of visibility. Implementing this scheme would not be difficult at all, but where is the incentive to raise the quality of proposals?

-------------------------

icme | 2022-04-05 16:16:20 UTC | #6

This doesn't fully block governance proposals from reaching the NNS, but by fixing the amount of governance rewards disbursed in a 1-week period, **it helps by reducing any financial incentives** that would come from spamming the NNS (which is why we are receiving spam proposals currently). In fact, this makes it cost prohibitive to spam more proposals (as there is no longer an increasing payoff to creating additional proposals and reaping the additional governance voting rewards).

Decreasing visibility would most likely mean setting up an automated spam filter, which I'm happy to discuss but might be better suited to another forum topic, as in my opinion it would be important to set this up without introducing any features that would over-censor proposals.

@ArjaanBuijk had a great addition to make sure that spam proposals would never see the voting floor.

@jwiegley Glad to hear there aren't any significant technical hurdles required in implementing this scheme.

In response to your concerns, these specific solutions don't block any proposals from reaching the NNS,  but it does reduce any financial incentives that would be gained from creating more NNS proposals. By spamming proposals, the spammer is now essentially burning ICP for visibility.

I believe creating a template for NNS proposals coupled with a spam filter for NNS proposals would tackle the proposal quality issues more directly, as long as that spam filter is not too restrictive. I really like this approach as it would be complementary to solution **3** detailed above.

Now the NNS would have the following guards:
- A spam filter in place to handle the proposal quality issue
- Fixed governance rewards over a given time period, resulting in an increasing financial burden (and no financial incentive) to anyone attempting to flood the NNS with governance proposals.

Plus to me it seems that the extra rewards for Governance proposals are decreasing, so it might even fix itself - if all (majority of) stakers will start to vote or follow some other neuron (they must have noticed decrease in rewards already).

willguest | 2022-04-05 21:47:55 UTC | #11

@justmythoughts  I'm really happy you put this up. I am quite intrigued by how this will play out.

With regard #1 it seems that, when only the participation % is important, you can no longer connect the amount of governance done to the benefit to the network (rewards). The governance itself kind of loses value.

Tangent: This means that an organisation founded with the purpose of crafting readable, packaged proposal of exactly the type we need has little financial incentive to operate. Whether they produced 1 or 1000 in a week, the overall network benefit would not be recognised through rewards. Overall that would make it harder (or less likely) that such a organisation/DAO would exist or even engage with this process, which works against the goal of having better proposals.

For #1 and #2 (and generally), I find financial (dis)incentives a bit old-fashioned. They work proportionately to the wealth of the person and can also be considered costs and/or market tests. A "disincentive" fee could even work to facilitate the testing of public opinion via the NNS (diluting quality) as it provides a clear cost structure.

I like incubation as an idea because it follows a social route for proposal checking. Personally I can see how the SNS could do a lot to help this, maybe with an (open-source) automated spam filter between NNS and SNS followed by community-driven decision making.

A juror-type system could be one scalable option -- accounts getting called up by the NNS (or SNS) to review something -- and could offer additional rewards for time spent. Reviewers could be chosen at random, or from a pool depending on topic, or according to some criteria or (self) reported expertise. If I could choose, it would be 1 reviewer-1 vote, but I can also see how weighting based on previous attendance or participation could work.

Maybe this is all water under the bridge, if DFINITY will present a clear path forward. As someone seeing an SNS implementation on the horizon, I really hope that this does not get left to money and the markets, but falls to the community to resolve.

Based | 2022-04-06 00:04:05 UTC | #13

This is the solution, everyone's getting worked up and spazzing for no reason, its not even a requirement to log in every day to vote since anyone can blindly follow a neuron for governance and if you cant even do that then I couldn't care less if you miss out on your auto pilot "rewards", call it a tax for not paying attention and thanks for the extra tokens. Don't like it? Then vote ta da

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-06 01:08:06 UTC | #14

@plsak Thanks for bringing this up I was not originally aware of this roadmap item! As mentioned above, I believe a spam filter or “mechanism” would be complementary to fixing the governance voting rewards within a given time period. The one thing to be careful of with a spam mechanism is that it is not too restrictive - I’d be interested to hear from @diegop and the foundation on what their plans are for this spam mechanism.

Hi @willguest thanks for your input! 

A few points:

I’m not quite clear on what you mean here, can you elaborate on this a bit?

[/quote]

With respect to your comment on financial disincentives if the reward is fixed by time period, I think it’s important that voters participating in governance proposals are rewarded for their time - the question what is the appropriate reward amount  for a week of proposal votes is up to the community.

In the case where we have a bad actor that is not affected at all financially by the cost to create a proposal (say a whale or even a foreign country), @ArjaanBuijk had a idea that would act as a great solution

[quote="ArjaanBuijk, post:3, topic:11915"]
During the period a proposal is locked, a certain number of neurons must vote to unlock it. Neurons can not vote to keep it locked, but only vote to unlock it.

If a locked proposal does not receive sufficient signatures, ie. unlock votes, the proposal never gets unlocked and is deleted.
[/quote]

Based on this suggestion of a minimum support "signature" threshold, I’m imagining a future where the IC is massively successful and 1000s of governance proposals are created on the NNS each week. Many are spam and are caught in the filter, but let’s say 50-100 make it through. That’s still too much work for one person in any week. Proposals that have garnered the necessary support from the community will be well known, and default followee neurons/active members will search for the proposals that they support. As long as a proposal receives some minimal number/percent of votes, it would make it to the next round. The majority of spam/unpopular proposals would therefore “fall off the ballot” at this point, with no necessary action needed to be taken by the community in terms of reading/interacting with the spam proposals.

The question remains on how to motivate individuals or entities to vote on proposals that would pass that minimum threshold. Your juror-type system is an interesting and satisfactory solution, albeit a bit more active of a solution than I would like to be involved in personally, especially if I have a busy week and am chosen to review 10-20 of these incubated proposals. I believe that like a state ballot proposition, there should be enough organic support not tied to any financial compensation for an individual proposal to pass some minimum support threshold and unlock after the incubation period to make it to a "live vote".

The property that governance rewards are fixed per time period/basis ensures that NNS voters don't feel financially obligated to vote on proposals in incubation that have not reached a minimum support threshold. In this way, NNS participants then are not forced to read through and vote on 50-100 proposals just to find the ones they care about, but are only rewarded by voting on proposals that hit the minimum support threshold and unlock (or go "live") on the NNS.

Definitely agree that this would be a neat feature to have to an SNS - although I'd imagine each application would want to have a lot of control over each of the "toggle-able" weights and features. I'm optimistic given the recent influx of input around this solving this proposal spam issue that the community will come to a satisfactory resolution in due time!

On idea 1, I don’t really understand how it is different than the system today other than averaging over 7 days (or a month) instead of 1 day.  Is it because voting rewards would only be derived from governance proposals and nothing else?  If so, I could back that idea (it’s effectively the same as resetting default following for All Topics Except Governance).  Would you please clarify further?

On idea 2, how would you decide which is the most important proposal for voting?  And the second most important?  Etc?  Does it matter or are you assuming everyone will vote on every proposal?  That may be reasonable, but I’m just trying to understand the mechanics of the proposal weight degradation.

On idea 3, I like the idea of a delay period.  I have a recommendation for a slightly different twist.  When the proposal is submitted to the NNS, a forum topic should be created automatically that requires deliberation for 1 week.  At the end of 1 week, the proposer is required to submit a revised proposal before voting is initiated.  Not perfect, but I do like the idea of ensuring deliberation.  During deliberation, I suppose you could implement a Spam button to prevent the proposal from moving forward, but it seems that could be abused by people who don’t like the topic.  Hence, I’m inclined to think the forced deliberation part is good, but maybe not the spam identifier.  I also don’t think this disincentivizes spam proposals.  People will just be willing to let them play out.  The goal of spam proposals is either low cost advertising or higher voting rewards, so this idea doesn’t seem like it solves that problem.  

I still think spamming will continue until the root cause is eliminated, which is people going after voting rewards of people who are not voting on governance.  Eliminating default rewards for routine business proposals is one way.  Another is to let the spam play out until 95% of the voting power is configured to vote on governance.  I’m afraid the later will take a while. 

By the way, I love how you are focused on ideas that keep proposal cost low and encourage higher voter participation.  I think we have these ideals in common.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-06 02:29:25 UTC | #18

Hi @wpb, thanks for your feedback and the positive vibes!

I agree that #2 has a few flaws, specifically that this makes certain proposals more valuable than others. There may be a few tricks to make users unable to predict which proposal would be worth the most, such as delaying rewards to the end of the voting period (1 week, etc.) and then randomly assigning the decreasing rewards to each of the proposals within that period, but I agree that this would not be optimal.

I'd be happy to clarify if you can elaborate on how this would be the same as resetting default following for All Topics Except Governance, I'm a bit confused on that equivalence.

With this proposal, I'm only talking about extending the rewards for governance proposals to average over one week - this does not include other proposal topics. I believe the this change for governance proposals starts to make more sense when a 1-week incubation period is introduced in idea #3. 

This fixed rewards allocation over a 1-week time period instead of a 1-day time period does several things:
- It gives NNS participants more time to evaluate and vote on a proposal as well as allowing some predictability with respect to when a proposal will be live for voting. 
- It stabilizes the amount of governance voting rewards allocated, (which I believe are currently majority of voting rewards). 
- It requires NNS participants to stay active, but does not require them to have a part-time job as an NNS  proposals reviewer. :sweat_smile: 
  - NNS participants should be rewarded for staying up to date on governance proposals, but anything quicker than a weekly cadence turns into a part-time job/serious hobby. 
- It places an emphasis on requiring voters to check in and vote weekly on any governance proposals in order to maximize voting rewards, and removes the need to submit daily governance proposals in order to maximize voting rewards.

[quote="wpb, post:16, topic:11915"]

[/quote]

I really like this idea and support it - just a few edge cases/questions

1. This locks the deliberation period for one week - what if the creator of the NNS proposal wants a longer deliberation period, or to post the proposal with prior to submitting it to the NNS?
2. This requires a hook from the NNS into the forums, and centralizes the forums as the goto place to discuss Governance Proposals. What about people who want to submit a proposal on Twitter, Medium, or DSCVR?

Look into my comments above with respect to @ArjaanBuijk's suggestion on a minimum support "signature" threshold. I think the positive filter is better than requiring people to label a post as spam, which as you say could be abused. The best approach for handling spam is putting in place an automated and unbiased mechanism or filter, which it looks like DFINITY has on the roadmap for Q2.

Can you be more specific about the fixed reward allocation?  Voting reward allocation is already fixed every day.  Are you saying a certain percentage of that allocation would go to governance?  Are you thinking 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%?  I understand the 7 day average part.  I’m trying to figure out the fixed allocation part.

Yes, I think the percentage of the total voting awards attributed to participating in governance proposals over a 7 day period should be fixed to whatever the community aligns on (50%, 75%, 80%, etc.), regardless of the number of governance proposals submitted during that time period (0 to infinity).

I'm arguably not an expert on governance voting rewards and do not work for DFINITY, so my initial observations have simply come from noticing my mergable maturity, and following discussions on the forums.

Therefore, I did a bit of peeking into the code behind voting rewards and found this. I could be wrong, but I'll take each piece of code at a time in how I'm interpreting it.

The following code snippets are taken from the most recent commit as of this post (4ed64eb628db52d378c2b3c7db09f9f0ab6c3331)

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/4ed64eb628db52d378c2b3c7db09f9f0ab6c3331/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L1502

This essentially means a governance vote is 20x any other vote, and 2000x an exchange rate vote. Based on the estimates in the code, the breakdowns per day assuming a single governance proposal is cast each day look like this

- governance = 1 * 20 = 20
- exchange = ~100 * 0.01 = 1
- others = (a handful) 5 * 1 = 5;

Therefore, if one governance proposal per day is submitted we would have roughly 20/(20+1+5) or 76% of all voting rewards attributed to governance.

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/4ed64eb628db52d378c2b3c7db09f9f0ab6c3331/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6028

This piece of code calls the aforementioned `reward_weight()` function for each proposal, and then for each voter ballot increments the voting rights by the reward weight for both the individual voter, and the total voting rights of all voters on the NNS.

https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/4ed64eb628db52d378c2b3c7db09f9f0ab6c3331/rs/nns/governance/src/governance.rs#L6053

This piece of code calculates the reward for each voter based on `(used_voting_rights * distributed_e8s_equivalent_float
                        / total_voting_rights)`

What this says to me is that even though total daily voting rewards on the NNS are capped by the `distributed_e8s_equivalent_float`, the more governance proposals there are per day, the more that percentage reward allocation due to governance proposals could go up. For example, let's look at if we now have 2 governance proposals per day.

- governance = 2 * 20 = 40
- exchange = ~100 * 0.01 = 1
- others = (a handful) 5 * 1 = 5;

All other proposal topics equal, if 2 governance proposals are introduced per day then roughly 40/(40+1+5) or 86% of all voting rewards are attributed to governance.

One can imagine if then someone submits, 5, 10, 20, etc. governance proposals per day that are voted - which may very well happen if someone reads this post. People will not have the time to keep up and vote on everything, which will cause more centralization around followee neurons in order to ensure NNS participants don't miss a vote. Those submitting the spam proposals would be counting on NNS participants missing a vote, and therefore taking rewards from those who missed a vote in this zero-sum game.

This is another strong reason of why governance proposal voting rewards per time period should be fixed. The logic shifts the incentives towards creating more governance proposals, instead of placing a focus on the NNS participants voting on the governance proposals that are created, regardless of how many proposals are created in a given time period.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-06 03:23:42 UTC | #21

That’s a perfect explanation.  I understand now and definitely agree.  In fact, your initial calculation feels right to me.  It seems a governance reward allocation of 75% of total available voting rewards is the right ratio.  I would not be opposed to 85% either.  You are definitely correct that this kind of fixed allocation would disincentivize low effort proposals.  

Of course it would need to be averaged over many days instead of daily simply because there are not enough governance proposals for daily allocation (as you have pointed out).  I think a 7 day (or 30 day) rolling average would work though.  It doesn’t have to be a fixed 7 day time period.  That way proposals can come out any day and voting rewards can be paid out every day.

This has been the Snowpiercer equivalent of the money train.

It should be fixed though, at least iterated upon.  It's a weird situation, exploitable by anybody to benefit those that actually have skin in the game and care about the future of the IC.

99% of those losing income as a result of spam governance proposals probably have no idea it's happening.

[/quote]

My point here is less to do with what is gained by fixed period governance rewards, and more to do with what is lost. 

In saying that, regardless of the amount of governance proposals created, the proportion of the rewards given to voters is fixed, you do indeed create a disincentive mechanism for the creation of spam proposals, but by creating a disincentive mechanism for the creation of _any_ new proposals.  

I appreciate that the motivations behind drafting and distributing proposals may be non-financial, but it seems like a shame to remove rewards-per-proposal altogether. I suppose my main point is that there may be good reasons for an increase in the number of governance proposals (e.g. an organisation facilitating community engagement) but this additional benefit could not be recognised in the form of directly increasing rewards, which seems counter to the goals of the network generally (but the NNS should know that already, right?).

Example: In one week there may be 100 really important proposals, because BTC has just been announced as the global reserve currency. The massive implications set into motion existing plans to update ICP governance and many of the "nearly there" proposals are quickly finalised and put to a vote. Let's say 95 of these have real substance and require community consideration. A few weeks later, over the holiday period, only 1 meaningful proposal is made and voted on. From a network benefit (reward) perspective, these two periods would be the same, assuming the cap is 76% (re your calcs).

I cannot disagree with your calculation of reward proportion, but I see this as a metric of activity rather than a true measure of value. If there is lots of genuine governance to take care of, it makes sense that a greater share of neuron rewards come from this activity.

@ArjaanBuijk had a idea that would act as a great solution

[quote="ArjaanBuijk, post:3, topic:11915"]
During the period a proposal is locked, a certain number of neurons must vote to unlock it. Neurons can not vote to keep it locked, but only vote to unlock it.
> If a locked proposal does not receive sufficient signatures, ie. unlock votes, the proposal never gets unlocked and is deleted.
[/quote]
[/quote]

I think the juror-type system is essentially the same idea, but with the difference being how the reviewers are selected. In this case they are self-selecting, whereas the juror model would have the NNS assign people to the role. I was imagining a set number of reviewers, which is equivalent to @ArjaanBuijk's unlocking value.

One benefit to this model is that it would cap the amount of time required to review new governance proposals, preventing reviewing from becoming a part time job, which i agree could make governance participation really dreary. 

Random allocation of reviewers from the NNS would also hopefully prevent small groups from pushing spam proposals through and could have a per-proposal reward structure like:

**review_reward * (no_of_reviewers / people_in_juror_pool)**

So if 100,000 people have agreed to be called as reviewers and 100 are needed per proposal, there is a 0.1% chance of getting called up. Let's say there is a 0.5 ICP reward for reviewing a proposal and (since this is a long term view) we estimate 100 proposals per year:

> 0.5 * (100 / 100000) = 0.0005 * 100 (over a year) = 0.05 ICP per person in the review pool.
Put another way, there is a 10% chance that you will review something in that year, for which you receive 0.5 ICP.

Some time later, we now receive 5,000 proposals in a year, but there are 1,000,000 people in the review pool:

> 0.5 * (100 / 1000000) = 0.00005 * 5,000 (one year) = 0.25 ICP per person in the review pool.
Or, there is a 50% chance you will be called up to review and earn 0.5 ICP.

This is treating all reviewers as equally qualified for all reviews. In reality, some people or organisations might show a real aptitude for review and I would hope that, in a transparent way, that could be recognised and their participation would be weighted according to demonstrable expertise or on the basis of community-driven ratings, but this adds a layer of complexity that might not be necessary.

One final thing you mentioned, @justmythoughts, is the concept of financial obligation, which I think is really important too. I can see how incentives could also become a burden. Having people opt in to a pool of possible reviewers might help to distinguish between those people who want rewards for passive (but still valuable) participation, and those who are happy to spend more time on reviewing.

Here is my contribution ...
Don't even know if this is feasible...or to difficult to implement in the NNS
lets say, DFINITY creates a rewards NFT for Governance proposal (something like Motoko NFT).
Now, all proposal weigh value gets reset back to what is was at the beginning, all equal value, besides that Each Governance proposal would get assigned a point value equal to the amount of neuron in existence (what ever that number is), every neuron that participates in Governance proposal voting by following or by manual voting gets 1 point assigned to it, so if every neuron in existence votes in the Governance proposal every one gets a point. The left over points from the neurons that didn't participate would get divided equally amounts the neurons that voted manually. After reaching certain amount of point ( to be determined)  the NNS will airdrop one of the afore mention NFT to that neuron. In this way you are incentivized to participated knowing that you might get something of possible future great value ($1000 ICP or just a nice jpeg :) ). This way the value of the reward is uncertain thus disincentivizing the creation of spam Governance proposals.

is this possible?

In saying that, regardless of the amount of governance proposals created, the proportion of the rewards given to voters is fixed, you do indeed create a disincentive mechanism for the creation of spam proposals, but by creating a disincentive mechanism for the creation of *any* new proposals.
[/quote]

You are right that this is a good argument against fixed governance proposal allocations.  I don't have a good response to this yet either.  To be honest, the system we have now hasn't incentivized many people from the community to produce high quality proposals. Frankly, its a lot of work to submit a proposal.  Figuring out how to submit a proposal (DFX commands today) is hard for most people, but it's the easiest part of the whole process.  Defining and documenting an idea, moderating deliberation, advocating for support, and the art of compromise are all difficult tasks and sends the proposal lead on an emotional roller coaster.  If the goal is for the community to offer more proposals that are high quality and well deliberated, I'm afraid new incentive mechanisms will be required.  Otherwise, it seems Dfinity is the only entity that really needs to use the governance proposal system with a few rare exceptions.

-------------------------

rbolog | 2022-04-06 18:43:59 UTC | #29

Another approach could be to add a "spam" button so we would have accept, reject and spam. If spam gets the majority then the submitter would be penalised. The penalty would have to be defined e.g. just an exclusion for a certain time.
This way we don't create additional complexity on the reward model.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-06 20:55:05 UTC | #30

If it's a spam proposal and spam doesn't count as governance, then people whose first priority is voting rewards wouldn't hit the spam button.
If it's a spam proposal and spam does count as governance, then the spammer wins anyway.
If it's a real proposal and there is a spam button option, then the minority side could just start calling the proposal spam to get it nullified.

So there are definitely a few downsides to having a spam button.

@willguest thanks for taking the time to explain your position 🙂

[/quote]

While I understand your argument, I fundamentally disagree with the idea that voters should be rewarded more when more proposals are created, and less when less proposals are created.

Think about your elected officials and ballot measures wherever you live - do you want your elected officials or yourself personally to be inundated with a larger volume of proposals of varying quality, or just those that reach a certain bar of quality, thought, and community support?

What if we've reached a system that for is stable, or in equilibrium - should we be incentivized to propose changes to the mechanisms in place just to earn more governance rewards? Artificially rewarding the active community by the volume of proposals of that are submitted does just this. 

A participant who submits a proposal to the NNS is someone who cares deeply about the IC, just like a local government official or ballot canvasser cares about the institutions they utilize - it has no direct attachment to financial reward, but there is an indirect incentive. For example, why did I create this post, and why have I spent hours doing so and responding to feedback thus far - I am both a developer and investor in the IC, and I believe that creating strong mechanisms around the IC will protect both my investment and projects by encouraging other developers, investors, and users to join and grow the IC ecosystem. 

Until recently, I believe that most NNS proposals created by the community had a similar motive - to serve, improve, and build confidence in the IC. These proposals range from @skilesare's multiple proposals trying to get ICDevs as a named default neuron in the NNS as a voice for IC developers, to @Kyle_Langham's proposal to index all neurons in the NNS, to @wpb's proposals trying to educate everyone on how to use the NNS and galvanize participation in the governance process. These don't "pay off" for any of the proposal creators in the short term, but will most likely have long term benefits to the IC (well - maybe @wpb's did have a short-term benefit :sweat_smile: , although he stopped the proposals earlier than planned after the goal of increasing NNS voting participation was reached).

Also, its important to point out that there is a pre-defined inflation rate for the amount of ICP minted and disbursed from the NNS. Proposing more governance rewards does not change this inflation rate, it simply increases the fraction of NNS rewards that are attributed to voting on governance proposals. The reason why you end up seeing more maturity is that there are still a large fraction of NNS participants that do not vote on these governance proposals - meaning that they are losing out on governance rewards, and those rewards go to the active voters. As @borovan mentioned, this is something that is directly exploitable and would result in a variable, but significant transfer of income from passive to active NNS participants, to the point where if 50 governance proposals were submitted in a day, over 99% of rewards would be given to active voters, and passive voters  would recieve less than 1% of the rewards, which is broken in my opinion.

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-04-07 10:09:03 UTC | #32

@justmythoughts All good points. I am not totally convinced one way or another in terms of rewards-per-proposal or not. My investor-developer interests are a bit conflicted as well.

I totally agree that having high quality proposals is the ambition (and that there should be a spam threshold), so why not make the rewards somehow reflect that, maybe with a scoring mechanism?

Imo votes on any sort of proposal should be pretty binary (Yes/No). Features like a weighted proposal score work in terms of judging proposals against one another (ranking), but don't work as well if you're asking people (not algorithms) to vote on a binary outcome. It just becomes super subjective, and make the process more complicated for voters.

Now in terms of a machine learning model (automated, not involving people), adding features with specific weights works pretty well -> for example, these features and weights are used when classifying your email as SPAM or HAM (not spam).

[/quote]

So you disagree with the principle of voting rewards? If the voting is not the thing being rewarded, then these are participation rewards and, if it is not the action of voting that determines your rewards, what does? 

Can I just click "participate" once a week/month, and then I am guaranteed the same reward as someone who reads every word of every proposal, thinks about them, maybe even does more research to fact check certain points or develop their perspective, and then makes as informed a decision as possible?

Honestly I find your argument to be based on a couple of theoretical or ideal situations, neither of which exist. Election officials can be corrupt (what?!) and not everyone who submits a proposal cares so deeply, evidently.

But I do not mean to attack you - I am a huge fan of the IC, in awe of the work already done and totally dedicated to building amazing things here (hopefully for years to come). I am so grateful to you for raising this topic. This is, after all, the foundation for the discussion... I just think that removing reward per proposal will lead to less engagement at a time when it is needed the most, by removing a piece of the NNS architecture that is central to participation.

In a stable state, I completely agree with your assessment, but we are a _long_ way from that. The governance system can also be changed and, if and when we reach that point, I may well have a different opinion.

Something does need to be done, however. As a constructive proposal, can I suggest separating the two concepts. The discussion on per-proposal or fixed-period rewards will likely always have people on both sides (and maybe it should), but the idea of reviewing proposals seems to have broad support.

*If it’s a spam proposal and spam doesn’t count as governance, then people whose first priority is voting rewards wouldn’t hit the spam button.*
- Spam button may reward as accept or reject so voters are not penalised

*If it’s a spam proposal and spam does count as governance, then the spammer wins anyway.*
- No spammer are penalised delay before next proposal and financial penalities

*If it’s a real proposal and there is a spam button option, then the minority side could just start calling the proposal spam to get it nullified.*
- Yes but how to define is spam or not except by voters

Note: if the main motivation of owner of ICP is getting rewards honestly I'm not sure ICP is the right choice.

Here is my take on Dominic's proposal spam solution. 

I call for A Proposal Action Potential as a preliminary action for proposals

We should have proposals go through a preliminary step where they are manually reviewed by random members of the community. These members should be given a bonus reward for taking the time to manually filter out proposals which could be spam.

Just like the action potential of an actual cellular neuron, this system only triggers when a threshold is met by voting participants. It is an all or nothing reaction. If the a majority believe the proposal to be valid it triggers fully into the NNS for voting.

 Remember we have to keep systems as organic as possible and as simple as possible with as little steps as possible. Instead of trying to rework a decentralized system from scratch we should directly observe decentralized systems already in place in nature and copy them accordingly.

Here is a link to a draft of the concept for those who are interested
.
https://jsu2x-syaaa-aaaaj-aafba-cai.ic0.app/proposal-action-potential.html

This system strongly resembles the mechanics of a firing neuron cell in the brain.

using randomly selected sample sizes of the NNS population with reward based voting also helps generate insight of what the opinions of the general community are. Of course I also believe accepted proposals should be discussed in detail as well before hitting the NNS. But for now I just wanted to focus on filtering proposals from users. Randomization and 1 vote per user system is heavily needed in the NNS to balance voting power imbalances.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-11 01:31:46 UTC | #37

Are you planning to submit this idea as an NNS proposal?  I was hoping someone would do it.  If nobody else takes the lead, then I was going to do a version of Dom’s idea myself.  I think it has a lot of potential for the reasons you cite.

Would you please document this idea in a google doc or directly into a new governance topic on the forum?  I’m having a very difficult time reading the information in your link.  I also suspect it cannot be posted as a proposal in the current format.  Hence, it should be time we’ll spent transitioning to a document format.  I’d like to read and comment once you create the forum topic.

If you decide to submit this as a proposal, you may want to comment on https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-call-for-proposals-to-resolve-non-actionable-proposals/12049?u=wpb too.  The goal is to coordinate effort at submitting these proposals to help filter ideas that the governing body wants to pursue further.

I really like the concept of a 1 user 1 vote type of system, but until we have people parties and proof of personhood this most likely won't work as intended. For example, look at the voting power that DFINITY currently holds, and how this voting power is distributed over many neurons https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfinity-foundation-voting-power/11801/2?u=justmythoughts

Therefore, randomly assigning neurons a "jury vote" will just encourage whales to split their neurons and voting power more sparsely, or encourage a system where users split their neurons as many times as they possibly can to game the system. This would actually counteract a fair 1 person 1 vote system, as a group of motivated enough whales could create a bunch of accounts and split their neurons as many times as possible across those accounts, and then open up the possibility where they are voting 5, 10, 50 times per preliminary period on proposals. As far as I can see, the only way currently to fairly hold a preliminary voting round (until proof of personhood is established) is to take this idea from @ArjaanBuijk

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-11 03:04:27 UTC | #39

You are making excellent points, but in my opinion the exact mechanisms don’t have to be worked out at this times. I think it’s the concept that is important right now.  All proposal ideas will need to include tolerance for Dfinity to shape the exact mechanics of execution.  That said, it does seem reasonable to identify these concerns as a risk that needs to be addressed in the proposal.  I guess I’m not terribly concerned because Dfinity is working on proof of humanity and it seems like implementation of this proposal would occur later in time than the rollout of people parties.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-04-11 03:46:47 UTC | #40

I think it's important for the community and DFINITY to shape those mechanics together, and **to send these types of voting change proposals to the NNS with their change mechanics as close to completely specified as possible** (for example, what was done with the Compounding Maturity Proposal, for which the mechanics were pretty much 100% specified in the forum post, or what you and @Kyle_Langham are suggesting in your reset governance voting followee neurons proposal, which has a well defined scope). 

Therefore, DFINITY (and eventually the community) will play their part in terms of implementation, but I don't think the community should raise or vote on proposals that change voting mechanics without providing specifics in terms of what the end deliverables or functionality changes are. Passing proposals without specifics is a good recipe for those proposals not being worked on, or ending up with an end deliverable that's vastly different from the original intention.

Imagine this like a ticket or task in a backlog - if that task is not well scoped in terms of deliverables, it requires extra work on the part of DFINITY to research and implement the feature after the proposal is passed, which puts more interpretation lee-way in the hands of the engineer(s) working on it, and could upon completion turn out to have a completely different twist then was the intention of the author and community who passed the proposal. 

I think we as the community should do our best to carve out as many knooks and crannies of a proposal as we can before passing it to ensure that proposal is appropriately scoped and of high quality, and is therefore easy to act upon and implement. **This requires participation from the foundation and from DFINITY engineers who are experts in that area of the IC**.

Having a discussion of how voting could when proof of personhood happens is an interesting discussion point, but I'm not sure that creating a proposal now based on future features that have yet to see the light of day is fruitful - lets cross that bridge once we get there and have an idea of what that future feature feels like.

<br/>

**Note:** This is different from DFINITY Roadmap proposals, which allocate foundation resources (engineers/researchers) to a specific area of the IC, and are essentially research and vision oriented, outlining the broad and general changes that we want to see. The equivalent here would be an NNS proposal saying something akin to "The DFINITY Foundation will research and develop solutions for combating spam proposals

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-11 04:04:03 UTC | #41

I agree with you about having a preference for dfinity engagement in deliberation.  I meant to second your comments to this effect earlier today on @Kyle_Langham post https://forum.dfinity.org/t/open-call-for-proposals-to-resolve-non-actionable-proposals/12049/5?u=wpb.  Unfortunately, I think dfinity has been quiet so far for a reason.  I suspect they want the community to deliberate these ideas before they get involved.  They may even want the proposals to be voted before they get involved.  At this point we don’t know, but it seems we should carry on until we get feedback otherwise.  Unless it’s a proposal that dfinity is sponsoring, they typically try not to interfere in the deliberation.
