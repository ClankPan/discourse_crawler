I say this should be a low priority for now. It sounds like the IC has more node operators waiting to jump in than it can handle. I would propose onboarding as many of the current node operators with the current hardware spec as possible, and then move forward with cutting the requirements. Once subnets with lowered requirements are stable, perhaps lower the requirements again and create new subnets. At each stage of this process, many technical issues will probably pop up. We can slowly address them as the network becomes more and more accessible to node operators.

I agree with lastmjs, this should be low priority. If I could I would personally put it near the bottom of all the current proposals. I think onboarding with current hardware for new node operators is a much better option for a while down the road then pursuing this path. There's definitely a lot of interesting things that could come out of this, but from my perspective, comes across as knee jerk reaction to a lot of FUD out there when that energy could be focused on more productive proposals for the Dfinity ecosystem. 

Long term? Great idea, would love to steal one of my partner's Raspberry Pis and do this. Next 1-2 years? I don't see what's to be gained personally at the moment vs other proposals.

michaelpanik | 2021-08-17 13:07:03 UTC | #4

I’m with the other two that it’s a fascinating concept and i can’t wait to be involved, but there are obviously bigger fish to fry. Focusing on core power and increased adoption will lead to the need for badlands naturally.

-------------------------

northman | 2021-08-18 03:12:49 UTC | #5

Think the name should be changed.  Badlands -- does not look good when presenting  - seems pejorative.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2021-08-18 07:46:14 UTC | #6

I feel that the prioritization should be maintained and not lowered. I base this reasoning on the fact that having minimal hardware (RaspberryPis) will boost the participation rate amongst the growing community. In addition the performance amongst different hardware stacks would become quite distinguishable. This will , then, justify the difference between high end nodes and the Pis; making it easier to understand why specialized hw is required.

-------------------------

aVontade | 2021-08-18 08:32:03 UTC | #7

I disagree with the notion that this topic is low priority - the disproportion of resources between the have and have nots , embed inequality and hampers entrepreneurial development in the developing world  - waiting to be invited to the table after the wealthy have developed the infrastructure will be an indictment to the vision of the Dfinity foundation - democratising opportunity.

Can Badlands be used as a testnet?

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-08-19 03:07:19 UTC | #11

I’m curious about this as well.

I really don’t care If Badlands exists as a subnet or as a separate chain. Either way it should serve a purpose. I think a testnet or ‘canary network’ would be beneficial.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-08-19 19:50:19 UTC | #12

Just following up. This is the kind of thing that makes me believe a separate badlands chain (or subnet if it can be isolated) would be beneficial for testing new technologies.

Hi y'all,

I just updated the summary to help differentiate between the proposals which are more baked and which those are still in more conceptual phases.

Fwiw, To see an example of a project which is more baked (and a model of how these proposals should look more like) check out the timeline thread on Increased Canister Storage: [Increased Canister Storage - #13 by flyq](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/increased-canister-storage/6148/13)

Dominic DFINITY founder tweets on July 31st, 2021, https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1421535126438223876


"MAJOR new Internet Computer blockchain advances coming, in likely order:

1. Service Nervous System (SNS) functionality for dapps

2. Bitcoin integration (Chain Key)

3. X.509 certificate authority (Chain Key)

4. Badlands subnet chains

5. Ethereum integration (Chain Key)"

My point is that when the founder of dfinity puts his weight in words, in my mind, dfinity would put their not-so-inconsiderable resources behind it. 

Am I mistaken?

Saj_ICP | 2021-08-28 16:29:28 UTC | #16

Implement badlands concept as new subnet chain. If forking a new chain is the selected option, it will have to be forked many times in the future to add node machines with different capacities.

-------------------------

Trevor | 2021-08-29 06:24:17 UTC | #17

Yeah, I think this relates to part of my post under Tokenomics. The communication on Badlands (and Endorphin) lead to confusion. I hope after these proposals are thoroughly discussed the foundation can help communication a clear priority and a bigger roadmap so we can all get a clearer picture.

-------------------------

rouven-d | 2021-08-29 15:28:28 UTC | #18

There are certainly a lot of conflicting pros and cons here. From my perspective, taking part in the network as an amateur node provider and potentially reaping benefits from it as well is very appealing. Otherwise, the current node machines distinguish the internet computer from other blockchains and provide enough computing power to serve the web-speed apps we are currently seeing. I'd love to have more information on the type of smart contracts for which amateur node machines would be the better option and then also how the interoperability between the blockchains (badlands and main) has to play out. 

On the other hand badlands could be a big step toward a more decentralised IC and it would allow people across the world and from different income groups to participate in the network without having to buy expensive equipment first. Hence, badlands could be a big democratisation step. 

What could be improved from my standpoint is the proposed way in which amateur node providers should be verified (people parties). Seems a bit too analog to me and would bring a huge coordination effort with it potentially hindering the speed at which an amateur network would establish itself. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on it!

-------------------------

ComputerInternetMan | 2021-08-31 22:24:58 UTC | #19

Without some type of Badlands participation on a large scale am unsure how the goal of ‘decentralizing the IC’ can ever occur.

Power centralizes …if u distribute power by increasing the number of participants you create the only real long term bulwark against your desired enemy … the centralization of power.

Is that the enemy you wish to fight or is it the one you want to emulate? The human condition is contagious folks…

From what I see the investing ecosystem is looking for the big demographic. They want B in front of the illion when it comes to eyeballs ( Worldcoin sign me up! )… if IC doesn’t implement Badlands … someone else most definitely will using comparable tech.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-09-02 13:47:45 UTC | #20

I think the system can be decentralized without Raspberry Pis or other low-end hardware. Does decentralization require cheap hardware? If there are enough independent parties who can afford the high-end node hardware, then we can achieve the desired level of decentralization. If Dominic did not misspeak in his latest podcast appearance on Epicenter, there is currently a queue of ~4000 node operators waiting to get into the network. That sounds like it will be very decentralized, no Raspberry Pis or other low-end hardware needed.

-------------------------

ComputerInternetMan | 2021-09-02 14:20:07 UTC | #21

There probably are quite a few applications …

If memory serves there are about 4000 independent data centers in US/UK/Germany/China ….total.

Obviously you can have concentrations of nodes in any particular data center.

Why are we limiting our imagination to the thesis that end user devices are cheap and inferior? Why are we even bringing up Raspberry Pi?

The access point and the pipe is agnostic to everything but the math.

What if u set up an access point in the data center?(like we’ve been doing for the last 30 years in telephony)…

Oh ….might that change the end user device?

Why yes it most splendidly could.

Why are we treating the term decentralized like they did in the early part of the century? Aside from being the ‘marketing spice’ is it not about the distribution of power among many participants?


That is the endgame consistent with the philosophy that I hear articulated by folks that preach decentralization uber alles. So let’s go there.

I cannot quite speak for the tweet you posted, but I think the reality is a composite of the following statements:

1. Dom sees Badlands as important but wants this to be something the community does want. There is a reason he wrote in his medium post the following:

> Everyone, please note: this is a technical pre-post for those interested in the Badlands concept, rather than a formal post announcing details of the project. There are several competing demands on the teams developing the Internet Computer ecosystem at the moment, including work currently underway to directly integrate the network with Ethereum and Bitcoin using “Chain Key” cryptography. Providing opportunities for amateur node providers remains an important objective, so I’m sharing this post today to provide an opportunity for community discussion.

2. The Foundation has multiple complex inter-layer projects while also scaling the network and infrastructure so there is a high bar for tackling more complex projects.

mega_peer | 2021-12-06 23:24:15 UTC | #25

One possible solution for a more decentralized layer on the IC would be to simply work with and integrate one or more other p2p compute projects geared towards consumer hardware.  This would provide developers alternative options for building apps with greater levels of decentralization or lower costs compared to only using IC canisters.  Building on a different protocol would of course be different and possibly more complex than building an IC Canister.

Some Possible Candidate p2p Protocols:
Holochain: https://www.holochain.org
OrbitDB: https://orbitdb.org
GunDB: https://gun.eco

guillaumestols | 2021-12-09 21:29:02 UTC | #26

I think this is a good moment to take back this badlands proposal. At first place, will it also have to comply to DMCA ?

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-09 21:28:34 UTC | #27

Second obvious question: how will it survive ddos ? throught internet identity ? or a kind of  "the power I consume, the power I host." Somehting like the good old bitorrent communities...Lets talk about it !

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-09 21:31:04 UTC | #28

Another issue: in some countries, you do not have a fixed IP (at least ipv4), so you cannot expose to the network. Is this easy to solve with IPv6 ?

-------------------------

akamilo | 2021-12-16 17:01:57 UTC | #29

New in here. My humble opinion while this proposal migth not be a requirement in terms of technology it could have a great impact in ICP adoption. The barrier to participate in the project could be much lower, it will enable enthusiastic people and devs in general to participate in the construction of a real internet computer even if it has lower performance any way many applications does not have such high performance requirements (may be thats why there are so many types of hardware and devices with diferent characteristics). The sense of ownership and participation of the community should not be undervaluated, look at NFTs, people likes to own things and to colaborate even if it is with a raspberry on a basement.
In the more technicall side of things there could be layers of performance for subnets (NNS verified) with diferent fees or other properties and the developer of a DAP could specify which layer to target for the deployment of his canisters.
Really like to see a masive adoption of this project in the right direction.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-24 05:21:53 UTC | #30

I think making the badlands a subnet or set of subnets would be great for decentralization and just having the option of hosting with high performance but reduced decentralization or low performance but increased decentralization is amazing on its own and I don't think any other network offers it. My only concern, which I haven't seen anyone mention, would be inflation. So there should either be no rewards for badland nodes or rewards should be paid in a sub-currency that won't affect ICP.

-------------------------

Zane | 2021-12-25 17:35:17 UTC | #31

In my opinion badlands nodes should require an ICP stake that can be slashed in case the node isn't reliable, so that providers are incetivized to provide constant uptime, if nodes where constantly being powered on and off it would be bad for the whole subnet.

I'd also like to see different types of badlands subnets, just like for standard ones. There should be very decentalized subnets with low HW requirements and subnets where an i7/i9 or equivalent CPUs are required. Badlands subnets should be paid based on the amount of "service" , be it bandwidth or CPU cycles, provided to the network.

-------------------------

Hashimoto | 2022-02-14 17:56:08 UTC | #32

I was initially against Badlands, because I thought it was a distraction from an already complex roadmap. However now on reflection I cannot see how we can have a truly censorship resistant ICP without something like badlands and as a separate network with a more limited NNS not just as a separate subnet. 

* Known data centres are easy targets for legal and political pressure,
* Token holders can easily be coerced via either exchange delisting or personal liability.

Properties required:

* Lower node and bandwidth requirements.
* Different token (initial distribution should be based on ICP but also some "mining") so can evolve own more censorship resistant culture.
* Anonymous and "Permissionless" onboarding (Staking & people parties)
* Bad actors automatically slashed or kicked of by in protocol mechanisms.
* Designed to be more private and censorship resistant rather than compliant. (Either ignorance .plausible deniability or market based methods (pay more to host stuff others don't want to host) )
* Node and client IPs hidden via a mix network.
* interoperable with main ICP network

But it is ok for it to be less performant and to require installation of client software to access it rather than just a browser.

It will create an interesting dynamic wrt censorship.

* Protects main network from censorship as censored canisters will just move to badlands.
* Protects main network from bad stuff as dodgy canisters will likely just launch on badlands rather than main network.

Whenever you talk about IC to another blockchain enthusiast they bring to the table that "it's not crypto because they need server farms". 

As others commented,  I also believe having a badlands subnet could really help with adoption. I wonder how difficult can be to implement.

It'll be great to finally decide to do it, so Dfinity can allocate resources in the future.

I think that sort of is what it is. IC is a completely different kind of platform to traditional L1s. It's simply just going to take a long time for people to realize it's its own new thing. Just like it took years and years for BTC and ETH to get major adoption.

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-04-23 09:04:36 UTC | #35

I suppose. Still I would love to feel that I run the thing myself.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-04-23 09:08:03 UTC | #36

There's a major cost to that though. This badlands network would run far worse than the current IC network, is that what you really want?

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-04-23 09:13:25 UTC | #37

I would prefer it to run as subnets and I'm ok with them having up to 10x decline in performance as long as composability is preserved. Idk, call me crazy.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-04-23 09:14:28 UTC | #38

The IC will never be truly decentralized and censorship resistant as long as nodes have to be hosted by KYCed individuals in data centers.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-04-23 09:25:39 UTC | #39

Not sure I agree with that, there are A LOT of data centers and entities around the world and if you utilize all of them you can't shut them all down. BTW I'm not against lower spec subnets I just don't think it's a priority.

BTW it's not a requirement in the IC protocol for nodes to be in data centers or KYCed.

-------------------------

marcio | 2022-04-23 09:44:44 UTC | #40

On the prioritisation side, I think having one badlands subnet of let say 100 nodes before end of 2023 would be nice and seems doable (without any prior knowledge of the technicalities).

Maybe someone from dfinity can shed light on the technical feasibility @diegop. It would be interesting to know as well, if the community decides to do it, do we have all the necessary resources (code, docs) available and open?

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-05-06 23:30:53 UTC | #41

Yes, I also disagree. Decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized organization to one that is distributed. Being known or not is not that important, especially if providers are geographically dispersed to minimize censorship. I am more concerned about the decentralization of the NNS. Because of this, Badland implementation should be thoughtful

-------------------------

memetics | 2022-05-07 08:49:08 UTC | #42

This is why raspberry pis should not be used and other higher end hardware should be prioritised instead

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-05-07 23:22:42 UTC | #43

I think slower connections and possibly higher replication factor will be the main bottlenecks rather than slower hardware. IC seems to be limited by bandwidth and latency.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-06-06 03:53:03 UTC | #44

Badlands should be a separate network whose main purpose is to decentralize voting power in the NNS and serve as Canary network for projects to deploy smart contracts a la kusama. It can also be used deploy assets that projects may not want to be #ICP due to the NNS political nature. I'm not sure what the hardware requirement should be.

-------------------------

memetics | 2022-06-16 07:39:57 UTC | #46

I think Badlands should at-least be added into the roadmap. We need badlands.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2022-06-16 10:08:50 UTC | #47

How exactly does badlands benefit the network? Adding extra computers doesn't bring anything more to the network as it currently stands and would just increase the amount of ICP minted 

If badlands were to be implemented this is how I would do it; as federated subnets
1) add a seperate classification for a "badlands" subnet.
2) creation of a badlands subnet is completely permissionless, the creator of the subnet inherits the power to add/remove nodes. The creator can also distribute this power among the nodes of the subnet for it to be either democratic or autocratic
3) developers can choose to deploy on the conventional ICP network, where the cannister is allocated automatically to one of the conventional subnets OR the developer can choose a specific badlands subnet to deploy to
3) the NNS voting system has no control over badlands subnets or their contents it simply indexes them so conventional subnets can access cannisters that are stored on them and vice versa
4) block rewards for badlands subnets are based upon gas fees, not latency deviation. Therefore no ICP is minted for blocks on badlands subnets

This implements the idea of federated networks that are composable amongst the unified ICP.

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-06-26 19:22:20 UTC | #48

I think badland brings several benefits to ICP. The very first big one is decentralization, assuming the holders have some voting powers in the nns. Secondly, it could be a canary network for devs to deploy their projects they make their way to ICP. Thirdly, since the priority for badlands is decentralization, certain projects could deploy their assets there to maximize security and decentralization, while keeping the front end and business logic on the IC. 

Validators would not get rewards in ICP. They would get in badland tokens.

-------------------------

memetics | 2022-08-12 08:29:28 UTC | #49

Decentralised network(badlands) which is fully functional would be epic

The forks below failed at becoming functional
Ethereum classic, Bitcoin cash, Sv, diamond and Bitcoin private

If we manage to deploy a functional sister chain, with complementary benefits to both chains then we are winning. 

No icp is produced to support badlands, instead we could even burn partitions of icp depending on how we run Badlands nodes/network

-------------------------

Forreal | 2022-08-14 02:48:39 UTC | #50

I know the foundation has its hands full, but Badlands could make both networks the most uncensorable platform in the world. Use Badlands for deploying assets and ICP for frontend and resource-intensive dapps.
