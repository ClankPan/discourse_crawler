Hey, I have been following Omnity network for a few months now. The team caught my eye thanks to an awesome member in my Openchat group. Bundt sent me this project to review and upon reading the litepaper I recognized that omnity network is exactly why I bought into ICP. 

Omnity network constantly highlighted what ICP brings to the crypto industry. It was the first project that I have found to not only build on ICP but to highlight why they decided to build on ICP.
Seeing them promote ICP on their own made me realize this team was serious about tech and not about pleasing mainstream narratives. I would like to invite people on this forum to test out the telegram app that gives you an ICP wallet and allows you to claim free "Rich" runes from omnity network. 

Here is the free claim to the tokens:
