I'm attempting to make a logout button and am trying to use the authClient.logout() method except I don't know what arguments it takes (if any) and how i should structure the argument I'm coding in javascript. A simple example would be great!

It doesn‚Äôt take any arguments, an example from Kyle is here: 
https://github.com/krpeacock/auth-client-demo/blob/e49918c450c79a4de90341ba2c4ce6a4d37c9d18/src/auth_client_demo_assets/src/views/loggedIn.ts#L42

Edit: Actually you can optionally pass it a url to forward on to after logging out, see docs:
[https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app/auth-client/classes/authclient.html#logout](https://erxue-5aaaa-aaaab-qaagq-cai.raw.ic0.app/auth-client/classes/authclient.html#logout)

Eg
`await authclient.logout({returnTo:‚Äùhttps://xkcd.com/710/‚Äù})`

Dear @kpeacock, should I recreate AuthClient after every `await authclient.logout()` call?

Thing is that `"key"` in set in `init()` method of `AuthClient`. This leads to this situation:

1. Fresh page load
2. Initialize AuthClient - inside its `init()` method `"key"` variable is set (does not matter from `KEY_STORAGE_KEY` or or `Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate()`)
3. logout by calling `await authClient.logout()` - at this moment storage is destroyed
4. without refreshing a page - login again. At `authorize-client-success` phase only `KEY_STORAGE_DELEGATION` key is set to storage.
5. We are logged in but we have no `KEY_STORAGE_KEY` in storage. 
6. Refresh the page - we are NOT logged in, because we have no `KEY_STORAGE_KEY` in storage

Which is better?

1) set `KEY_STORAGE_KEY` in the same `authorize-client-success` phase next to `KEY_STORAGE_DELEGATION`?
2) recreate AuthClient?

For what it's worth, in Papyrs, I explicitely set `authClient` to `undefined` after logout to recreat it. I added following [comment](https://github.com/papyrs/ic/blob/1720315aa8a9917d950f4ea1090e35c09e3cff62/providers/ic/src/providers/auth/auth.providers.ts#L107) in my code about it for my future self:

> Reset local object otherwise next sign in (sign in - sign out - sign in) might not work out - i.e. agent-js might not recreate the delegation or identity if not resetted

In NNS dapp we do not reset `authClient` explicitely because after each logout we reload the `window` anyway, therefore a new client will implicitely be loaded afterwards.

Two distinct solution but in both, a new instance of `authClient` is created.

Thanks for sharing your experience.
In all our products Usergeek/Canistergeek/Configeek I will also create a new AuthClient on logout üëç

The goal of `logout` is to close all timeouts and reset all the values, but there is no harm in simply discarding the instance and starting over when you start a new session
