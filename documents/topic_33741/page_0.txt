I have a question regarding HTTP Outcalls. When I attempt to send a POST request to a web2 API, I encounter the following error. The first request works fine, but the subsequent requests fail. The key difference is that the first request takes some time to process, while the following requests are faster. 

> The replica returned a rejection error: reject code CanisterReject, reject message Connecting to xx.samlinux.com failed: Failed to directly connect: error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Network is unreachable (os error 101), error code None

Have you checked if the API supports [IPv6](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/https-outcalls-how-it-works#ipv6-only-support)?

Thanks for that info, but after a long day searching  :face_with_thermometer: I have also found this info into the docs.

No, currently the service doesn't support IPv6. I have to find now a way to write my own service or configure the existing one if possible.

If it can be useful, few existing solutions listed there -> https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ipv6-support-for-https-outcalls/32766/2?u=peterparker

Thanks, @peterparker, for the links. I noticed your OpenAI proxy implementation. I followed a similar approach using Node.js. 

In my example, I need to send from content as emails from a website. But I had to use a specific SMTP provider based in Austria.
