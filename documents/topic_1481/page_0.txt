I am using dfx 0.6.12, and trying to deploy just one canister. I have two canisters named controller and frontend. When I run `dfx deploy controller`, just the controller canister is deployed. I get this text: `Deploying: controller`.

When I run `dfx deploy frontend`, both canisters are deployed. I get this text: `Deploying: controller frontend`.

This looks like a bug.

One idea I have is that `frontend` is some kind of keyword that I shouldn't be using as a name for a canister?

Most likely your `frontend` canister depends on `controller`. You can check if your `dfx.json` has a `dependencies` field for `frontend`.
