Are these CANISTER_ID env variables reachable directly in motoko? That would come extremly handy for inter-canister call, especially for setup with segregated env (we have dev/test/prod deployment on IC).. :slight_smile:

No, they aren't at the moment, but you should be able to discover the principal and text of the principal using the names of the actors and functions `Principal.fromActor` and `Principal.toText`.

For example:

```
// Subscriber

import Publisher "canister:pub";
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";

actor Subscriber {

  public query func getPrincipal() : async (Principal, Principal, Text, Text) {
    let p1 : Principal = Principal.fromActor(Subscriber); // my principal
    let p2 : Principal = Principal.fromActor(Publisher); // imported Subscriber's principal
    let t1 : Text = Principal.toText(p1);
    let t2 : Text = Principal.toText(p2);
    (p1, p2, t1, t2);
  };

}
```

If that's not a solution, I'd be curious to know what else is missing.
