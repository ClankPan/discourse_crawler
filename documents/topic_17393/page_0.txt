Deprecates `@dfinity/authentication`, moving the `isDelegationValid` check into `@dfinity/identity.`

Also moves `Secp256k1KeyIdentity` out of `@dfinity/identity` to its own package, `@dfinity/identity-secp256k1` in order to keep package sizes down for other packages.

`@dfinity/identity-ledgerhq` is deprecated, and had already been out of use for some time. `@zondax/ledger-icp` is the maintained tool for integrating with the Ledger hardware wallet.
