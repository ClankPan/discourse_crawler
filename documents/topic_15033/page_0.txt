I propose for the organization to form an official team, which tackles the topic UI and ease of usage on icp 

Members should be.

Non programmers,
Non IT Specialists
Non crypto users

Just general ppl from all ages, ethnicities, whatever.

 Topics to be tackled.

Ease to acces icp apps?
Ease to create internet identity? 
Ease to understand what is icp?
Etc.

If it’s hard for them, make it easier until it’s so simple, anyone can use and access icp apps and nns without having to research hours on end.
