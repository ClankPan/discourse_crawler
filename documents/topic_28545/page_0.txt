I have in my package:
- src/backend
- src/backend/CanDBIndex.mo
- src/backend/CanDBPartition.mo
- src/backend/lib.mo
- src/backend/Main.mo
- src/lib
- src/lib/Types.mo
- src/lib/Verifier.mo

But at https://mops.one/passport-client/docs only
- backend/lib
- lib/Types
- lib/Verifier

are documented. Why are `src/backend/CanDBIndex.mo` & `src/backend/CanDBPartition.mo` not documented? Does `mo-doc` document only modules and no actors? or why?

How to make `mo-doc` to document all my source files? Specifically, how to make `mops publish` to respect this?

It's quite possible that mo-doc fails to document actors - it was originally designed to implement the base library modules so perhaps this was never implemented fully.
