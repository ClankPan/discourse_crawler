Really interesting [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/prediction-markets-for-content-curation-daos/1312) by Vitalik back in 2018.

It's about how a community can collectively moderate user-generated content in a high-throughput platform like social media. The proposed solution is prediction markets for 99% of content + a moderator DAO for the remaining 1%.

Back when Vitalik gave the talk, he said that the main barriers to adoption were:
* scalability of blockchains
* usability of blockchains
* high transaction fees
* high latency (i.e. transaction finality times)

All of these are solved by the Internet Computer.

Any thoughts? I feel like community moderation is the future, and prediction markets provide a scalable way to do community moderation.
