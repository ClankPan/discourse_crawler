I made that as a backup incase I lost access to my hardware wallet but I realized it just creates more of a security risk, because if I lose my hardware wallet or whatever I already have a 24 word seed phrase to recover that, it is fully generated off the internet. I wish I could remove the option to have a backup seed phrase, thank you.

Itâ€™s impossible to remove the option to have a backup seed phrase, as it uses an algorithm to generate the private and public keys. If someone gains access to the seed phrase, they can derive the same private and public keys.

On the other hand, if you lose access to your device, the backup seed phrase is your only way to recover your funds. Would you accept the risk of losing access to your own funds if someone stole your device and you had no backup seed phrase?
