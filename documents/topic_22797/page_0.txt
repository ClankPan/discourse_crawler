Waiting for for the `dfx extension` to be released and I wonder if it is possible to implement an extension that will use [mocv](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/moc-version-management/19011) to select moc version for canister building?

How I see it:
1. One time? For each project?
```sh
dfx extension install mocv
```

2. dfx.json:
```json
{
...
  "moc": "0.9.8"
...
}
```

and on each Motoko canister deploy extension will resolve path to the specified `moc` version binary
