Dominic and Vitalik were talking about stablecoins together in January 2015...
Maybe this is why the Internet Computer does not want to integrate USDT or other stablecoins?

if put $ICP as main coin to use in IC ecosystem like BSC use $BNB.  I think it's not a bad idea either.  increase value for $ICP and increase holders of $ICP when demand is high.

Yeah. There should be a direct bridge on chain between IC and the fiat system. Stablecoins like USDT will definitely change the game if integrated into the IC ecosystem. Of course there might be a large risk, but algorithmic stablecoins will play a role in the future even though we have seen the crash of UST.

algorithmic stablecoins is a dangerous ponzi game.  it can kill the whole ecosystem.  I have never seen a successful algorithmic stablecoin model.  due to market volatility.  stablecoins that need to be backed by fiat will be safe for both users and the ecosystem.

Maybe a stablecoin can be backed by Bitcoin, because only in this way we can make everything transparent on chain. Neither USDT nor USDC is 100% transparent. In fact, as long as a stablecoin is backed by fiat, it can never be 100% transparent.
