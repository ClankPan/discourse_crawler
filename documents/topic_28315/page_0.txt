I started learning web3 and motoko. In the instructor's video, I noticed autosuggestion. When I typed my code I noticed autocomplete doesn't work although I have already downloaded the Motoko extension from Difinity Foundation.

It's been a while since I've used it myself, but it used to be the case that you need to be in a dfx project, with a dfx.json file nearby for the plugin to have enough information to do its job.

Something like:
```
dfx new myproj
```

```
cd myproj
code .
```
But perhaps that's not required anymore or something else is wrong.

Are you on Linux, Mac or Windows/
WSL?

I am using Windows and dfx the code works fine. But there are no suggestions when I type.

Hi @KIsaac85, thanks for reaching out. Here are a few debugging questions:

1. Does this happen for other languages or just Motoko? 
2. Do you see any error messages when opening VS Code?
3. Presumably you are using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) on Windows. Is that correct?
4. Would you be able to send a screenshot of what this looks like?

Thanks for you reply.
No just Motoko. Other languages work fine. I am using WSL on windows and the code works fine. 
I posted the same question on stackoverflow with screenshots.
I tried to upload pics and link for the stackoverflow link here and got *an error you can not upload a picture in a post* :frowning:

[Is this your StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78140372/how-to-get-autocompletion-for-motoko-in-vs-code)? The autocompletion should work without any extra configuration, so this may be caused by an error in the language server. 

Can you send me a direct message with your "Motoko Language Server" console output? This is what it looks like on my machine for reference:

Would you also mind sending the dfx version that you are using? This can be found by running the command `dfx --version`. 

Until you get the extension working locally, you could also try using an [online Gitpod environment](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dfinity/icp-hello-world-motoko):

Thanks for your help. Yes, that's my post. I can not upload a picture in a post, I'd appreciate it if you could send me your email address. I am using dfx version 0.9.3

> I am using dfx version 0.9.3

This might be the issue. The latest version of dfx is 0.18.0, so I would encourage [following these instructions](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/10552713577364-How-do-I-install-dfx) to reinstall dfx. I'll send you a direct message with more information.

Hello!

I also have this kind of issue, i'm on a windows (WSL) and also watching Angela Yu's motoko tutorial.

Have you ever fixed this issue?

KIsaac85 | 2024-07-22 06:48:33 UTC | #11

No, unfortunately not resolved ðŸ˜¢
