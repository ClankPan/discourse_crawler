Hello guys - can we still launch on SNS in the future if we say already launched our token on a DEX ?

Hi there!
Every SNS launch will create a new ledger with a new SNS-specific token that will be the token used for staking in governance. 
If the project already has a token before the SNS launch, it would have two tokens afterwards. 
Depending on your use case and setting this might be desirable or not. 

I hope this helps a bit. If you have additional questions, please feel free to ask them here or in the SNS office hours!

and that governance token is going based on our original tokenomics? What if our token is part of our utility token - will we have a say in the name of the new SNS-specific token? Or maybe I should go read up more about it all...
