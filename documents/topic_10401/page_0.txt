Hello,

I needed timezone data for one of my projects, I extracted these features and then made it available with a JSON interface (so I could test http_request :wink:).

The web interface is [here](https://atdc4-4aaaa-aaaal-aacrq-cai.raw.ic0.app)

The source [code](https://gitlab.com/kurdy/tz4motoko) and [API](https://gitlab.com/kurdy/tz4motoko/-/wikis/API)

Thank you for your interest

This would make for a great entry in the canister registry! (By just adding the backend canister id to the listing itâ€™ll let others explore the interface):
