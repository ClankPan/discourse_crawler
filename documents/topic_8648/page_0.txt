## Description

This bounty gives the opportunity to

* learn how motoko works
* learn about unique ID encodings
* learn about randomness on the IC

A donor(The Dragginz Team) generously funded a full bounty for ICDevs to help find a dev that would like to build a UUID library.

The spec for UUID v4 can be found at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122

Quint has done a ton of work on this already at https://github.com/aviate-labs/uuid.mo. As a result, we'll give him first dibs on this bounty if he wants to update the library to add the pseudorandom non-await branch.

There are a number of example libraries in other languages.  You will need to transcode the library into motoko.  This may require the construction of other sub-libraries for encoding, string manipulation, and decoding.

There are unique properties that the IC has that you should take advantage of.  The IC provides randomness via the [Random](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/base-libraries/random) base library.  This library should have two modes. One where true randomness is used and another where an alternative form of randomness that does not require an async await to be used.  Perhaps hashing the Principal of the canister plus an always increasing nonce might do the trick but a healthy discussion should ensue about what will work and what won't.

## To apply for this bounty you should:

* Include links to previous work writing tutorials and any other open-source contributions(ie. your github).
* Include a brief overview of how you will complete the task. This can include things like which dependencies you will use, how you will make it self-contained, the sacrifices you would have to make to achieve that, or how you will make it simple. Anything that can convince us you are taking a thoughtful and expert approach to this design.
* Give an estimated timeline on completing the task.
* Post your application text to the Bounty Thread

## Selection Process

The ICDevs.org developer's advisors will propose a vote to award the bounty and the Developer Advisors will vote.

## Bounty Completion

Please keep your ongoing code in a public repository(fork or branch is ok). Please provide regular (at least weekly) updates.  Code commits count as updates if you link to your branch/fork from the bounty thread.  We just need to be able to see that you are making progress.

The balance of the bounty will be paid out at completion.

Once you have finished, please alert the dev forum thread that you have completed work and where we can find that work.  We will review and award the bounty reward if the terms have been met.  If there is any coordination work(like a pull request) or additional documentation needed we will inform you of what is needed before we can award the reward.

## Bounty Abandonment and Re-awarding

If you cease work on the bounty for a prolonged(at the Developer Advisory Board's discretion) or if the quality of work degrades to the point that we think someone else should be working on the bounty we may re-award it.  We will be transparent about this and try to work with you to push through and complete the project, but sometimes, it may be necessary to move on or to augment your contribution with another resource which would result in a split bounty.

## Funding

The bounty was generously funded by a donor(The Dragginz Team). If you would like to turbocharge this bounty you can seed additional donations of ICP to 66083bb3c940c7de2a70aa127ec771da75d60deadc10f5f66b280f203d8f6e73.  ICDevs will match the bounty 1:1 for the first 20 ICP and then 0.25:1 after that.  All donations will be tax deductible for US Citizens and Corporations.  If you send a donation and need a donation receipt, please email the hash of your donation transaction, physical address, and name to donations@icdevs.org.  More information about how you can contribute can be found at our [donations page](https://icdevs.org/donations.html).

## General Bounty Process

### Discussion

The draft bounty is posted to the DFINITY developer's forum for discussion

### Ratification

The developer advisor's board will propose a bounty be ratified and a vote will take place to ratify the bounty.  Until a bounty is ratified by the Dev it hasn't been officially adopted. Please take this into consideration if you are considering starting early.

### Open for application

Developers can submit applications to the Dev Forum post.  The council will consider these as they come in and propose a vote to award the bounty to one of the applicants.  If you would like to apply anonymously you can send an email to austin at icdevs dot org or sending a PM on the dev forum.

### Assigned

A developer is currently working on this bounty, you are free to contribute, but any splitting of the award will need to be discussed with the currently assigned developer.

### In Review

The Dev Council is reviewing the submission

### Awarded

The award has be been given and the bounty is closed.

The (old) UUID package is updated, is now also contains a very easy to use UUID generator that is based on `Random.blob`.

Fun fact:
> Randomly generated UUIDs have 122 random bits.  One's annual risk of being hit by a meteorite is estimated to be one chance in 17 billion, that means the probability is about 0.00000000006 (6 × 10−11), equivalent to the odds of creating a few tens of trillions of UUIDs in a year and having one duplicate.

Are this one and the ULID "Finished"?  If so I'll start review and maybe send a PR with some text to add to the readme about the bounty?

I would say they are 'almost finished', I would like someone to look at it.
Especially to check the API, whether it is user-friendly. But yes, it is about ready.

Feel free to open issues/pull requests!

Code looks good, can you add a "quickstart tutorial", how to import your motoko lib etc... ?

There is an `example` directory, is there anything else you would need to get started?

This Bounty has been closed out and awarded.  Quint elected to forfeit the prize back to the ICDevs treasury as part of his joining the [Developer Advisor's Committee Board](https://icdevs.org/developer_advisory_committee.html).  We appreciated the [donation](https://icdevs.org/donations.html) and are super excited to have Quint's influence on board.  Quint has contributed an immense amount of code to the motoko ecosystem and we should all recognize his significant contributions.
