**Authors: [Pete](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/pete/), [bjoernek](https://forum.dfinity.org/u/bjoernek)**

Hi all,

We present a revised design proposal for the community fund (CF). It includes several adjustments based on points raised by the community during the first [deliberation round](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-fund-design-proposal/13701).

In particular, the revised design provides additional flexibility, allowing neurons to leave and join the CF at any time. This way, users can try out the CF without committing participation for the life-time of a neuron. Also, users keep the flexibility to manage the maturity of their CF neurons, e.g., merge, spawn etc.

Following the deliberation of the revised design in the forum we intend to submit a motion proposal.

## Background and objective

* The success of the IC is dependent on the services built on the IC. Similar to Ethereum, we envisage that, in the long run, the value of services built on the IC will collectively be worth more than the IC itself.
* The CF introduces the concept of an NNS controlled treasury. The goals of this treasury are to aid the bootstrapping of the SNS DAO ecosystem, and later be able to re-invest in the continued growth of the ecosystem. The NNS will be the decision maker in choosing where its treasury or CF resources are to be invested. This will be extended in the future to support additional community developed governance and fundraising frameworks (i.e. opportunities from these frameworks will also be featured in the Launchpad).
* To allow the CF to create this treasury, community fund neurons will expose their maturity to the risks the CF fund is taking when investing. Maturity of CF neurons will be reduced when the CF decides to make investments. At a later date CF neurons whose maturity was reduced will be rewarded with maturity increases, dependent on the success of the investments the CF has made.
* Involving the maturity of CF neurons instead of their stake in ICP minimizes the impact on the overall ICP tokenomics.

## Proposed design

The community fund process can be split into five phases: (1) joining the community fund, (2) making an investment decision, (3) the decentralization sale, (4) participation in SNS governance, and (5) increasing maturity when SNS neurons dissolve. In the following we describe these five phases in more detail.

![Screenshot 2022-08-04 at 17.05.21|690x382](upload://7Hp9ECDQCg8RYCcBcavWEr8rGId.jpeg)


### Joining and leaving the CF

* Using a tick-box in the NNS FE dapp, a neuron can join and leave the CF at any time, also during a voting period.

### Voting on investments

* The CF investment proposal is part of the SNS proposal. It is essentially a statement “Invest X ICP from the CF into this SNS”.
* As a consequence, all NNS neurons will vote on both the creation of an SNS for a dapp and on whether the CF invests into that dapp.

### Decentralization sale

* If a proposal to create an SNS is adopted, the decentralization sale starts. The maturity of CF neurons is reduced pro rata by an amount related to X.
* If the decentralization sale is successful, the NNS mints X ICP as specified in the proposal.
  * The SNS treasury receives the X ICP.
  * The NNS CF treasury receives SNS neurons corresponding to X ICP. This is provided as a basket of neurons with various dissolve delays.
* If the decentralization sale is not successful, the maturity of CF neurons is increased again by the amount it was decreased by earlier.

### Participation in SNS governance

* Participation in voting on the SNS proposals is passed through to the CF neurons via hotkeys on the NNS neurons owned by the NNS.
* The voting weight is proportional to the maturity exposed.

### Increasing maturity of CF neurons

* The NNS CF treasury holds SNS neurons & tokens in its treasury, to be sold at its discretion.
* When a set of neurons from a decentralization sale of an SNS dissolves, the NNS marks to market the value of the dissolved SNS neurons. In the first stage, the marking to market is done by a proposal. In a later stage this could be done by pulling data from a DEX.
* The maturity of CF neurons whose maturity was reduced when an investment in a SNS-controlled dapp was made is increased by the amount determined by the NNS.
* The NNS can sell the tokens from an SNS at a later point in time with the goal to maximize the sale price. After the NNS sells tokens from an SNS, the received ICP will be burned.

## FAQ

* **I can spawn maturity myself and invest directly in an SNS. What is the benefit if I join the community fund?**
  * Correct, a user can spawn maturity and invest into SNSs also without the involvement of the CF.
  * Via the CF, a user can tap into the knowledge of the IC community and can also benefit from an automated investment process.
* **The dashboard currently shows the stake of all NNS neurons in the CF. Will this be adjusted to also show maturity?**
  * Yes, given the revised design the metric on the dashboard will be adjusted to display in addition the total maturity of all CF neurons.
* **As a CF neuron holder, how can I avoid participating in a particular SNS if the NNS voting is trending towards accepting the SNS proposal?**
  * If a particular CF neuron holder is not in favor of following the NNS’s decision for a proposed SNS, it can leave the CF (before the end of the vote) and re-join later.

* **Why does the NNS treasury not sell the underlying tokens of SNS neurons immediately when the SNS neurons dissolve?**
  * Directly selling at the moment when the neurons of an SNS dissolve would not be a good approach, because this would flood the market of that SNS token at a predictable time.

* **When is maturity deducted from CF neurons?**
  * When the SNS proposal has been accepted (by NNS voting), the appropriate amount of maturity will be deducted from the CF neuron.

* **What happens if CF neurons opt out of the fund during an SNS vote?**
  * If CF neurons opt out of the CF whilst an SNS vote is open, then the ICP amount the CF was proposed to make is reduced proportionally.
  * If neurons opt in during an SNS vote, the ICP amount the CF invests in an SNS remains the same, but maturity of each CF neuron will be proportionally decreased less.

* **If the NNS itself is an investor in an SNS who votes on SNS proposals?**
  * Voting rights in an SNS will be passed through to the community fund neurons via hotkeys. The NNS will remain the owner of these SNS neurons.

* **What happens when an SNS neuron owned by the NNS dissolves?**
  * When an SNS neuron dissolves, the NNS will be the controller of liquid SNS tokens. The NNS will have the option of selling those tokens for ICP, or keeping the SNS tokens.
  * At this point a market value of the tokens will be assessed and CF neurons which are exposed to this SNS investment will be rewarded with an appropriate amount of maturity.
  * Any ICP raised from the selling of SNS tokens will be burned.

I'm still undecided whether this is a good change or not, while locking neurons in the CF for life might be considered too extreme, it was a mechanism to assure allocation to promising projects was only reserved to true believers in the ecosystem, the new mechanism despite being less restrictive could favour whales with large ICP stacks and fat neurons way too much.

What if 2 SNSes launch at the same time but I only want to fund one of them?

I believe it'd be best if this decision was up to the project owners, such systems should be as unopinionated as possible imo, it should be up to the market to decide whether the terms proposed are convenient or not.

How is allocation determined? Say a project wants to sell 7k ICP worth of tokens, is a fixed amount reserved for all neurons in the CF to make sure each one of them gets some (as long as they have enough maturity)? Are CF neurons prioritized over investors using tokens?

As a side note I think it'd be great if we could generalize the CF's functionality of automatically disbursing maturity so that it could be used for more than the CF, e.g I want to support a DAO/project and I want to send them a % of my maturity each week/month/etc..

People that invest directly into SNS will able to obtain the right to control the token that we invested right??

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-04 22:42:32 UTC | #4

I might be out on a limb here, but why do we need a community fund, especially since it’s another app directly attached to the NNS?

Can’t the IC community form their own investment DAOs, where these funds can be more heavily weighted toward games, social, or DeFi?

I get the concept and benefit to SNS launched projects, but I don’t understand why DFINITY has to do this, especially given the recent discussion around roadmapping and allocation of resources.

As far as I’m concerned community fund was part of the pre-genesis plans, but a lot has changed since then. Maybe now’s a good opportunity to re-evaluate where the community stands with respect to the community fund, and to ask and see if people would be outraged if plans the community fund were scrapped.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-04 22:54:30 UTC | #5

Agreed, I find the concept of automatically reinvesting maturity interesting though and imo if it were to be generalized we could have many equivalents of the CF built by the community, each one with a different focus as you suggest.

Another use case which I find very compelling is funding dev teams to work on the IC protocol, as recent events showed, community proposals can only add a task to a wishlist but there are no guarantees on how and when it will be implemented by Dfinity.

So we could build a DAO where "bounties" are listed for each approved proposal and we as a community can fund these endeavors by giving a % of our maturity or even donate tokens, which will be rewarded to those who complete a bounty first, tasks with bigger bounties would be the ones with most community interest so even the priority problem would be somewhat solved.

As many community members already suggested, Dfinity should focus on providing us the building blocks and let us use them to our heart's content, instead of giving us a packaged lego set which only satifies a subset of the community.

-------------------------

It would be helpful to briefly summarize the difference between this CF proposal and the previous. (Although I don't think we ever voted on a motion proposal for the previous one.)

wpb | 2022-08-05 12:06:39 UTC | #7

Hey @bjoernek @Pete would you please help me understand all the different ways we can invest in SNS projects?  I only see 2 methods listed in this post and both are related to investing maturity only.  One is the investment of maturity from community fund neurons (but not the stake) and the other is identified as a user spawns maturity and invests in the SNS without involvement of the community fund.  Are there going to be any options to invest ICP or staked ICP in the SNS?

I'm quite concerned about only being able to invest maturity in the SNS.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that would exclude a large fraction of smaller NNS participants who staked after genesis.  My perception is that post genesis neurons probably merge maturity on a regular basis so they can accumulate ICP instead of accumulate Maturity.  It's been a way to alleviate some of the negative price action since genesis.  My perception is that owners of genesis neurons are more likely to have accumulated Maturity.  If this is correct, then larger genesis neurons will be the most likely participants in SNS launch events.  Wouldn't that be another story of "the rich getting richer" based on this constraint of only investing maturity.

Have you studied these demographics?  Do you know who are the most likely participants in SNS launches?

Our intention is not really that the opt out should be used to decide case by case what to fund, but that the user is committed to the NNS decision making on the CF for the long term. This is more an intended as an emergency exit to be used when a CF neuron holder strongly disagrees with the direction. So we are not planning to add more flexibility.

The NNS proposal which initiates the decentralization sale will specify both the total amount of ICP worth of tokens they wish to sell (min & max ) and also the CF ICP investment in the same proposal. So yes the CF does have a guaranteed allocation, though the project can configure the ratio to ensure there remains ample opportunity for everyone.

[/quote]

Note that maturity is not a transferable asset it always remains an attribute of a neuron. It's an interesting direction to explore though of auto-converting maturity into ICP and being able to donate/invest that ICP into other projects/DAOs.

Thanks so much for the detail. Does it at all feel premature to launch the community fund before getting real feedback on the SNS? As in walk before we run? 

Also, the community fund does feel like a regulatory nightmare. If investors lose a ton of money I can see the SEC coming after Dfinity itself rather than the projects involved. How do we view that risk? Seems like we are playing with fire a bit. Fully realize that it is technically decentralized but we are moving into very unchartered waters here from a regulatory standpoint right as the SEC has its antennas up.

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-07 19:38:06 UTC | #10

Yes. Anyone who participates directly in an SNS decentralization sale, will receive SNS tokens locked in a basket of neurons with different dissolve delays. The basket and delay period can be configured by the project.

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-07 19:51:06 UTC | #11

There is nothing in the proposal which prevents the IC community forming their own investment DAOs. The NNS having a community fund and other investment DAOs are not mutually exclusive.

The NNS being involved in the launching of SNSs (both being the entity which initiates the decentralization sale and with the CF, also investing in the SNS) is agreed somewhat of an opinionated vision for the role of NNS.

If the SNS are successful and grow to be as large or larger in value than the IC itself, the CF is an opportunity for the NNS DAO to also benefit from this growth. Any ICP raised from selling SNS tokens will be burned, which could reduce the quantity of ICP in circulation.

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-07 19:57:46 UTC | #12

The direction of "bounties" and allowing the NNS itself to start to solicit improvements and not just approve them sounds like a great direction to explore to me. There will be some finer details to work out, maybe this is an initiative we could start a working group to explore.

It could be interesting to combine this with some kind of quadratic voting.

Understandable, but still I'd rather have a less opinionated system and let the market decide.

That's a good point, the best would be if

 we could choose between 2 option:
- convert maturity to icp and send it to any address
- send only maturity but only to neurons, this way DAOs could benefit from the experimental tax evasion feature and decide when to convert the maturity to ICP based on their tax requirements.

Yes please, QF is such an interesting topic and could bring a lot of improvements to governance in the IC ecosystem

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-07 20:08:13 UTC | #14

Yup - we did not put the previous design to a vote.

Major differences; 
- Opting in and out of the CF can be done at any time. Previously we offered a window to opt out prior to CF go live, but after CF go live there was no opt out option.
- SNS neurons received from the CF investment are controlled by the NNS. Previously the SNS neurons received were controlled by the CF neuron owner. Voting rights are passed on via hotkeys.
- CF funding of an SNS is part of the main SNS decentralization proposal.  Previously there were two NNS proposals, one for the SNS decentralization sale, and one for the CF investment.
- It's clearer that the NNS CF is making the investment in ICP and CF neurons are exposing their maturity to the risks. Previously it could be interpreted that CF neurons were investing maturity in a project.

Anyone will be able to participate in an SNS decentralization sale, by committing ICP. It's certainly not a requirement to have a CF neuron.

It was easy to miss, but you can see the outline of how this will look like in the NNS UI here https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-frontend-design/13847

I don't want to wade into a tax discussion, but evasion is a strong term! There is a big difference between tax evasion and tax planning. So I feel it's my duty to state that non of our proposals are intended to support tax evasion or avoidance!

This is one of the issues I have with expanding the ties and scope of what the NNS is, and what it’s dependencies are (within the app).

My original understanding was that the NNS is the governance tool for the IC, and that was it’s primary purpose and connection - for staking funds into neurons that vote on proposals controlling the IC.


Since then, we’ve now added an SNS dependency on the NNS, and now DFINITY is further adding an investment arm with a dependency/tie-in to the NNS through the community fund.

The NNS is the central hub for the IC - to keep pushing forward with an “opinionated” vision, even against the wishes of the (non-DFINITY) community is bound to spark conflict with many in the community.

Specifically, I’m referring to expanding the scope of the NNS app over the agenda items that the community has already proposed and passed for the NNS. These agenda items aim to improve/enhance existing functionalities instead of adding new features that haven’t even been voted on by the community.

To clarify, I don’t think idea behind investing maturity through the community fund is a bad app idea.

If DFINITY wants to set up a community fund app that’s completely separate and de-coupled from the NNS (i.e not hosted in the same canister or domain as the NNS app), then that’s their prerogative, and can be it’s own self-contained app run by DFINITY - but I don’t see why does the CF needs to directly tie into the NNS app. Once we’re changing even the UI of the NNS app, now updates to the CF require an NNS vote, and I’d guess that most voters in the community don’t want that coupling or responsibility.

Afaik it was done to give more visibility to the CF and SNS launchpad, no need to advertise a separate site.
Stakers use the NNS to vote/stake/manage maturity, some do this on a daily basis, so once a new tab comes up its safe to expect they'd click on it out of curiosity.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-08-07 21:01:12 UTC | #19

I can stand behind this choice, its not ideal but it makes sense at this stage. What I don't like is the system is too opinionated and some of the functionality its based on, namely the transfer of maturity between neurons, isn't exposed to us.

Not only it'd allow for new interesting use cases as explained in my post above, it'd also make it possible to move maturity between neuron with different lockup periods without incurring in modulation.

To build on where @Zane is going. I think, as you point out, one of the tensions at the moment is that the NNS is functionally setup today to act more as a gatekeeper than a DAO with its own resources which can be used to directly influence the direction.

The proposal includes the idea of the CF being extendable to support other community developed governance and fundraising frameworks. Extending the CF beyond the app layer and into supporting the development of bits of the core protocol or core dapps (possibly via bounties) seems like an equally logical extension. 

[quote="justmythoughts, post:17, topic:14691, full:true"]

DFINITY effectively operates its own community fund using is own resources today via the grant programme. An NNS controlled community fund would seem additional, complimentary, and independent to that. 

The contradiction is, whilst it can appear like DFINITY pushing its own vision here, that opinionated vision is that the NNS should have the capability to play a more active role in the IC ecosystem. Whilst this proposal may not be perfect, you could see the CF as an experimental baby step in this direction of the NNS being able to deploy its own resources and influence the direction of the IC. 

I don't see this as an either-or-question. DFINITY, independent devs & DAOs in community, and the NNS itself should all be able to play an active role. Each has a different dynamic and so over time we will see how successfully each influences the IC in different ways. However it would be a shame to shut off experimentation with the NNSs role at this early stage of the ICs evolution.

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-08 10:36:32 UTC | #21

I think moving maturity between neurons is probably not going to fly (as attributes can't be moved around), but the idea of generalizing the CF to make it less specific and opinionated and allow a more diverse set of goals and activities to be funded/supported is a sentiment I agree with.

Happy to explore this direction further.

In fact, NNS brings the investment of CF intervention in sns and additional costs for developers. Clearly, each vote for NNS is a heavy debt for SNS, and the developer takes on the additional debt of all of NNS's pledges compared to raising funds directly from individual investors on Launchpad.

Not only does the project owner have to pay for the gas produced by ICP, but it also has to repay NNS for the votes.

This seems to be saying that all programs under ICP must be directly responsible for all stakers of NNS or you will not be able to raise funds.

Apologies this was confusing. The ICP raised by the decentralisation sale will be controlled by the SNS and can be used by the SNS as they wish.

At a later date when the NNS becomes the controller of SNS tokens from the neurons allocated to the CF in the decentralization sale, if the NNS sells those tokens for ICP that ICP will be burned.

Whilst the NNS has some properties which other venture DOAs maybe do not, it's not all one way. Other entities maybe have advantages such as nimbler decision making or vertical focus which make the decision to use the NNS/SNS/CF route advantageous for some projects and not so for others.

If the SNS are successful and grow to be as large or larger in value than the IC itself, the CF is an opportunity for the NNS DAO to also benefit from this growth. Any ICP raised from selling SNS tokens will be burned, which could reduce the quantity of ICP in circulation.
[/quote]

In fact, NNS brings the investment of CF intervention in sns and additional costs for developers. Clearly, each vote for NNS is a heavy debt for SNS, and the developer takes on the additional debt of all of NNS's pledges compared to raising funds directly from individual investors on Launchpad.

Not only does the project owner have to pay for the gas produced by ICP, but it also has to repay NNS for the votes.

This seems to be saying that all programs under ICP must be directly responsible for all stakers of NNS or you will not be able to raise funds.
[/quote]
I'm not sure I fully understand your argument here. 

Projects have the free choice to evaluate the trade-offs and decide of they wish to a) use the SNS launchpad as their decentralisation vehicle or choose another community built DAO launchpad b) decide if they would like the CF to make an investment in their project as part of that decentralization sale.

Moving maturity around neurons with the same PrincipleID could work though no? For example, I could then send, for example, "5" maturity from a 8 year neuron to staked maturity from my 6 month neuron. That would be very helpful for a lot of folks.

-------------------------

Pete | 2022-08-09 15:33:42 UTC | #25

The constraint today is maturity is an attribute of a neuron so by design it can't be moved around. I will discuss with the team if ownership by the same principal could alter that constraint.

I already suggested this months ago while discussion for the maturity proposal was still on going, this is what a dfinity dev said:

https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/203

Not sure what happened to that request.

-------------------------

blockpunk | 2022-08-09 16:42:31 UTC | #27

Thanks for your answer.

On the last point, I think there is no free choice for IC projects. the addition of the NNS vote has actually given privileges to both SNS and CF, with SNS getting the privilege of more replicated nodes and more security, while CF is basically seen as a credible proof of NNS for the project.

The key is investor judgment. NNS voting offers the privilege of if much, and if projects are not certified by NNS, investors will view them as high-risk and off-brand. Projects with NNS certification are obviously more attractive to investors, and all projects have to go out of their way to get more NNS votes.

This necessarily adds more costs to the project side. As an example in Polkadot, projects need to participate in slot auctions to get some privileged features, and each auction needs to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in votes, which is a terrible debt for the ecosystem, so a number of projects have fled the Polkadot ecosystem.

This can limit innovation, and I've talked to a number of programs that have had headaches with the NNS vote.

N may I know if there any future privilege, perk or incentivization to the 8years neuron that joined the community fund?

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-11 10:51:30 UTC | #30

Maybe I am misreading here, but it seems that through this method, maturity is calculated as equivalent to a certain amount of ICP at a given time.
Does this not go against the grain of the tax-related proposal which aims to obscure how much exactly maturity is worth by adding a modulating mechanism at dissolution? In other words, if we can calculate exactly how much the maturity in a neuron contributing to the community fund is worth, would that not also apply to the maturity of all other neurons, which can then be used by tax authorities to determine taxable income?

There is no special treatment for 8-year neurons. However these kind of neurons collect the most maturity and thus can exposure more maturity to the CF.

We are working to make the higher replication subnet a protocol feature which is available to any other canister or project. It's on the core protocol part of the recently published roadmap
https://internetcomputer.org/roadmap

So yes there are some characteristic of an SNS from a trust perspective (trusted canister WASMs, and initiation of decentralization) which may not easily be replicated given the NNS has some unique characteristics from a trust perspective. We are trying remove any un-necessary additional privileges which accidentally may have got included with the SNS implementation.

I can see your point. 

Possibly another way of looking it is as a spectrum of costs for creation of a DAO from zero (in the case of a completely permissionless design) to hundreds of millions of dollars in the polkadot example. I'm not sure it's healthy to have zero costs, as a project does need to establish some degree of credentials and trust prior to involving users in a DAO creation, but I would also worry if we end up with very high costs of DAO creation.

The framework we have put in place is that the NNS has the autonomy to decide what costs it wishes to place on projects. The NNS DAO could establish a voting convention that SNS creation requests are only rejected in case of the most egregious of abuses, or it could alternatively decide to impose very high costs on projects. If the NNS chooses poorly then there will be a natural opportunity for others to fill the gap with a DAO creation framework with lower costs but hopefully with similar levels of decentralised trust.

If under this guarantee, then the creation cost of DApp DAO is still reasonable and unlikely to be a problem in the short term.

But IMO this guarantee is not reliable in the longer term, because the mechanism already exists and you can't predict every voter's decision forever. When some NNS voters find it profitable to suppress the project (and projects may be forced to concede more concessions in order to pass NNS), everything will be changed.

This is not guaranteed in the system.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-08-12 06:57:21 UTC | #34

Hi @Denis, 
I would describe it as follows:

* A user can expose maturity to the community fund and as a result the maturity might increase at a later point in time. As part of this process the user does not receive tokens or neurons, as the NNS is the owner of them.
* The NNS could also mint ICP and invest in SNSs without any reduction in maturity of CF neurons. However by reducing the maturity of participating CF neurons, we reduce potential impact on tokenomics as this maturity cannot be spawned, while it is exposed to the CF.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-12 07:09:41 UTC | #35

Thanks, @bjoernek, I'm probably being dense about this, but I'm not sure if this answers the basic question. In your proposal you state that the Maturity of CF neurons is reduced by X pro rata and SNS treasury receives X newly minted ICP as part of the swap. This indicates that maturity is being valued at a particular rate of ICP at a given time. Does this not undercut the compounding maturity proposal? Tax authorities will simply say that it doesn't matter whether the final maturity is modulated, since it is obviously being valued at a certain rate currently.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-12 12:15:46 UTC | #36

Here is the description of Maturity Modulation in the wiki:
• Maturity is an attribute of a neuron; it is not a tradable asset. The decentralized governance of the Internet Computer can change the treatment of maturity at any time.
• If a user wants to generate income from maturity, he/she needs to burn maturity to create new ICP via spawning a neuron which is a non-deterministic process.
• The maturity modulation function introduces uncertainty in the creation of ICP from maturity. This article explains how the maturity modulation function works.

As far as I can tell, the Community fund treats maturity as a deterministically tradable asset.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-08-12 12:46:52 UTC | #37

I just want to leave my voice here that I am adamantly against a Community Fund officially sanctioned by the NNS: https://twitter.com/lastmjs/status/1558069812827488261

For these reasons:
1. Exposes the entire NNS DAO to unwarranted legal and economic risks
2. The facts and circumstances of each project are unique, and legal and economic designs should be specific to those projects, and the consequences scoped to those projects
3. This will complicate the NNS, split its purposes and focus, and distract it from being laser-focused on governing the core IC protocols, which I believe should be its main (perhaps sole) purpose
4. The community can develop their own DAOs to focus on fundraising

I am afraid that if we incorporate the Community Fund into the NNS, we will bring many problems upon us in the future stemming from the reasons I listed above (and perhaps others I haven't thought of).

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-08-12 13:20:56 UTC | #38

ICDevs.org uses a (not very well used due to interface issues) "Dedicate a Neuron" feature that lets you point your neuron at ICDevs and lets us use the maturity as a donation (see https://icdevs.org/donations.html).

I don't see why we can't set this up as a separate DAO with nothing to do with the NNS that uses the same functionality.

It can basically work in exactly the same way just not connected to the NNS.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-08-12 15:17:18 UTC | #39

Thank you for your feedback @Denis, and this is an important and probably a subtle element!

The key point I would like to make is that the NNS is minting new ICP and invests it in SNSs. The maturity of CF neurons is not swapped against ICP but rather only locked until it is released/increased again. 

As a thought experiment, you could imagine that the NNS CF invests in SNS without CF neurons exposing their maturity. The fact that you lock the maturity of CF neurons ensures that the impact on inflation is kept minimal (because the locked maturity cannot be spawned).

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-12 18:06:26 UTC | #40

Thanks for your response, @bjoernek. These issues are pretty complicated, it is fair to say, but since so much effort has been expended on the maturity modulation feature, it is worth getting things perfectly straight.
So, let me take this example. Say, I contribute maturity from a neuron to the SNS which in turn provides ICP to a dapp. Now, say, the dapp fails completely and all the money invested it is lost. What happens to the maturity that was frozen from my CF neuron pro rata?

-------------------------

willguest | 2022-08-13 14:50:22 UTC | #41

I would also just like to chime in to second the opinions put forward by @justmythoughts and @lastmjs that I think the NNS should rather aim to function at a protocol level, with only necessary exceptions.

It is a shame to see the "doesn't stop anyone else from doing it" argument used again, as this is not really addressing the central concern which, imo, is that this allows the NNS to have a formal preference in the expenditure of ICP and, even if it is DAO-run, has a preferential place in the ecosystem, unavoidably leading to some kind of central power structure. This makes it very hard to describe the NNS as an agnostic system that does only what it is told (albeit quite intelligently).

In my view, one of the most revolutionary elements of the whole ecosystem is the NNS, not because it produces governance but because it merely enacts it. It is primarily administrative and, as a result, makes a beautiful connection between trustless, cryptographic systems and system-scale administration. With this change, there is definite creep into active management that I think taints the whole priniciple.

I will vote to reject.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-08-13 15:00:55 UTC | #42

While this all may be true, what are the upsides / downsides in terms of actual consequences? 

Downsides 

1. Authorities shut it down due to regulatory / legal risk 
2. Folks lose money if CF doesn’t perform 
3. Distraction of time and resources for foundation if unsuccessful / is shut down  

Upsides 

1. Massive funding source. There’s about $2BN of maturity untouched that can be contributed to ICP projects. Some folks would prefer to invest in diversified fund rather than individual projects. 


2. *Recurring* funding source for ICP projects. It is recurring as folks can assign future maturity to the fund. ICP value is ballpark $4BN (looking at total supply). At 10% inflation thats $400M. 5% of that is $20M annually. 

3. The hype that the IC desperately needs. May attract developers from other ecosystems if they believe it is easier to get funded this way than the normal route. 

If A bunch of projects get funded this way and then the CF gets shut down that may be a totally fine outcome … 

Do you see the downsides as much graver than I’m painting ?

-------------------------

EmrahCoskun | 2022-08-14 08:22:36 UTC | #43

The Neuron owners should be able to choose between "**Maturity Investing**" or "**Neuron Investing**". :wink:

I think CF is generally a good way to invest in projects, but investors shouldn't be able to invest just with their maturity. ICP that you want to make available for CF should also be 100% investable.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-14 13:48:55 UTC | #44

How does this work?  How do you receive the maturity and convert it to ICP?  If donors add your principal as a hotkey to their neuron, then you can see the maturity, but you can't disburse the ICP.  Do they have to disperse the maturity by spawning a neuron, waiting 7 days, and then sending the ICP to the ICDevs account?  In other words, is this a pretty labor intensive process for the donor?

-------------------------

memetics | 2022-08-14 14:57:07 UTC | #45

Hi I’m struggling to understand why someone with a neuron with staked icp would ever join the community fund when they can just spawn icp and participate that way ? 

What if neuron holders, whilst in the community fund, could allocate a portion of locked holdings, into that project, min1 icp capped at 5% of holdings. This could be a huge use-case for staking icp. Earn whilst waiting to invest

Surely some benefits have to be formed, or it’s a pointless feature… unless you’re a whale with 10k+ icp we’d only be investing scraps.. Someone help a smooth-brain understand the CF

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-15 09:40:08 UTC | #46

I think it comes down to the CF neuron owner not having to mint ICP in order to participate in the community fund.  It is a transfer of maturity between a CF neuron and the NNS, not a transfer of ICP.  That has tax advantages to neuron owners who hold a lot of maturity.  About 70% or all maturity earned since genesis has not been disbursed, so the community fund provides a way for those investors to make their maturity useful without having the tax burden.  It's potentially a pretty big pool of funding that can bootstrap new projects on the IC.

Just wanted to give everyone an update on the ICP Maximalist Network neuron vote for the Community Fund proposal.  All votes have been submitted and our neuron voted NO to the proposal.  The tally of voting members was 3 yes and 9 no votes.  Our vote cast 10.2% of total voting power in the NNS due to liquid democracy.  

There are a variety of reasons why our voting members voted no, many of which have been posted on the forum or Twitter.

Our vote swung the overall tally to a result that now stands at 12.6% YES and 13.5% NO.  ICDevs had previously voted NO.  Cycledao voted NO at the same time ICPMN voted NO since they are following our neuron.  DFINITY and ICA have not voted yet.  The voting period has been extended by another 1 day 15 hours since our vote swung the vote so heavily.

Even though the ICP Maximalist Network has been around since just after genesis and we have a lot of very prominent members of the IC ecosystem that participate in our network, there are always people who don't know us.  In order to answer that question in light of our impact on this proposal, I am linking our public document that identifies our voting members and our neuron voting policies.  Please don't hesitate to join our Telegram chat group if you have any questions.

People can follow ICDevs on the manage neuron topic.  Every time the maturity gets >1 ICP we spawn the maturity to a new neuron that ICDevs owns, then we dissolve it.

I haven't looked at the underpinnings of this yet to see if we could use Maturity instead of a spawned neuron(Can you split your neuron into one that holds all the maturity and one that doesn't? I'm not sure).

I wish it were otherwise, but I have severe doubts that any taxing authority will view the use of maturity in investment as anything other than converting it to income, so jumping through hoops seems a bit overkill.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-08-14 15:59:44 UTC | #50

Got it.  I forgot they can follow your neuron for the Manage Neuron topic.  I suppose most of your donors are genesis neurons, so they have to set that up using DFX or Quill.  Have you provided instructions on how to set this up in the NNS dApp?  Is it even possible with the NNS dApp redesign?  This may be another reason it would be good for DFINITY to expose the Manage Neuron proposal topic in the NNS dApp.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-08-14 16:20:25 UTC | #51

They took it away after about two weeks after genesis because the interface was confusing and people were giving DFINITY and ICA control of their neurons.  They could easily add it back now that the conversion is complete to svelt. I'm not sure if it is on the road map or not.  

These were the instructions :joy: :rofl:, but I haven't updated them since the svelte upgrade:


using nns:
Follow Neuron 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic(instructions). This is a bit more complicated as it still requires using the web console. Using chrome:

1. Log into the NNS and navigate to the neuron you want to dedicate.
2. Right click and “Inspect”
3. Go to the Sources Tab and navigate to top/nns.ic0.app/ic_agent.js
4. Search for “this.follow = async” (about line 1793)
5. Add a breakpoint on the next line by clicking the line number. This line should say something like “await updateRequestHandler_1.submitUpdateRequest(……”
6. Leave the console open and go to the “Following” box.
7. Click Edit Followees.
8. Click A topic for which you have 0 followees. ie “Exchange Rate”
9. Expand the topic and click Add Followee
10. Put 14231996777861930328 in the Followee Address box and click “Follow Neuron”.
11. Your breakpoint should trigger.
12. Hold your mouse over the ‘request’ variable on the line. This should bring up an interface to edit the properties of the request.
13. Change the topic to 1.
14. Click the “play” button.
15. Confirm that your neuron now follows 14231996777861930328 for the Manage Neuron Topic.

I am one of the voting members for the ICP Maximalist Network who voted YES to this proposal.  It was a very difficult decision for me because I think this proposal primarily benefits whales with fat neurons and I am not one of them.  However, when I think about what is in the long term best in interest of the IC, I think we need this community fund.  

It concerns me that there is so much neuron maturity that is undisbursed. About 70% of all maturity that has been earned since genesis is still sitting in neurons and the total amount in ICP equivalents is growing significantly due to inactivity of the neuron owners to spawn or merge.  There is no time lapse on liquid maturity.  If it were all spawned suddenly it would flood the market with ICP.  If it were merged all in one day then everyone's voting rewards would go down significantly.  Now with the new modulation function, there is incentive for people to watch the modulation parameter and spawn when they can get an extra 5% (like right now), which will suppress upward potential on ICP price (it can also suppress spawning when price is dropping).  There is no cap on maturity and the eventual unknown disposition just makes me uncomfortable.

This community fund proposal gives those neuron owners a new option and ties up their maturity for some period of time as it works through each SNS token launch.  Right or wrong, I suspect this new option has tax advantages and will be attractive to the whales that are able to participate.  Their participation in the community fund will fund dApps on the internet computer.  Hence, there are potentially significant growth opportunities.

I understand all the arguments against this proposal and I agree with them.  It also pains me that this proposal seems like it will benefit whales more than it will benefit post genesis small investors.  However, I think the greater good for the IC is to support this proposal and potentially unleash a significant amount of funding that can benefit the ecosystem while simultaneously locking up some of that massive maturity that nobody talks about.

-------------------------

radudaniel | 2022-08-14 17:58:19 UTC | #54

I am a voting member of ICPMN neuron. I voted YES for proposal 74820.

The maturity which is layong dorment could be used very well to fund new projects. This will atrract devs and this maturity will be put to better use than being sent to exchanges to be sold. 

Even if part of the maturity received by projects will hit exchanges, they will have already brought talent and attention to IC.

There can be many improvements made, but theorising about them is not the best way forward. Small iterations after feedback comes from usage is a healthier approach in my view.

That is why I voted YES, to have more projects, devs coming to build on IC as funding is available and done directly using the SNS which will also have the spotlight in all this.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-08-15 09:31:04 UTC | #55

Thank you for your feedback @Denis. And agreed that this is a complicated topic, as this is a quite new funding vehicle.  Regarding your question: You are right that exposed maturity would be probably lost if the linked SNS project completely fails (in the end this requires a decision from the NNS on how to reward the CF neurons for blocking their maturity).

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-15 17:25:48 UTC | #56

Thanks, @bjoernek . I will not go on about this further, because few in the community seem concerned about it. In any case, it makes no difference to me, I was against the modulation proposal anyway and have no personal stake in its outcome. But I do believe the way the SNS swap is structured undercuts the premise behind maturity modulation as a tax dodge. I just hope ICP holders in the US keep enough funds liquid to pay the tax guys who are sure to come calling.

-------------------------

justmythoughts | 2022-08-16 05:03:31 UTC | #57

@Denis, many of us in the community **are** concerned about the changes to maturity as a tax optimization (dodge) scheme, as well as the CF. I assure you people are seeing your concerns - please continue to voice your opinions.

We’ve just unwillingly accepted that DFINITY is going to push through these changes regardless of what the developer and named neuron community thinks.

jsull9 | 2022-08-17 07:01:17 UTC | #60

I'm obviously not trying to give advice. Although, I believe this is an absolute fact about USA users/ investors. It is what is making me nervous as well. I'm 85% there with understanding this process. However, I don't feel US users can actively voice their opinion without creating FUD, or being run over by the community. So, I feel like I need to remain quiet with any of my concerns. However, I 100% agree, that US users might need to save enough liquid ICP to pay those taxes. It's something that the community outside of the US is not going to particularly understand (zero judgment I wouldn't understand the tax process anywhere else). As a noob, I did not grasp the concept (and still am struggling) however, I know when I sit with my CPA/ tax attorney this year things will be evident. It makes me think that USA users are either thinking let me bypass the tax man by not reporting my maturity, or join cf to make it even more complicated to determine for a lack of a better way of putting it. I'm thinking I cannot even join the CF until well after the optimization of taxes occurs, or it becomes clear what the IRS will be taxing. I truly believe soon enough we will be taxed on our maturity/ rewards. When I spoke to a local CPA/ tax attorney (yes I finally received legal advice for those who know I've asked in the past) he stated that my maturity to the state of NY would more than likely act as a dividend payment as if investing into a savings account. So, when US users are like this is complicated, we're literally not kidding. Then, come tax time, the fees or fines individuals may end up accumulating in either back taxes, or unreported reward maturity could significantly outweigh any gains made. Not to mention if ICP goes upward and smaller investors now have over 10k it might create more confusion, and people inadvertently avoid paying the proper taxes. You may even end up spending more money on the fines and fees if you don't keep some liquid/ report accurately. So, to me as a US user, I do not believe joining the CF is plausible. Nor, do I think that it helps any smaller investors in the US. I think for those in other regions it's going to be amazing. For US users it's going to be another opportunity we have to miss, in order to understand how to report it to our ungrateful, backstabbing, two-timing, joke of a big brother (aka IRS/ USA government). This is just my opinion. I'm not giving advice or suggesting US users panic. Just what Im discovering by investing in my area/ state. I really don't know if the project can really reach more average investors and users in my area because of this issue.

Also, individuals who think the US can be sidelined and is not needed for the development of the project should really consider where the most BTC is being mined and accumulated. Also, where the 8 holders of most of the IC nodes are located. All I am saying is tax optimization is going to be crucial to gaining more traction in the country. If we cannot compromise, and leave the money hunger at the door. I foresee a rough future ahead. These are just my thoughts. Some US users are really remaining quiet on this issue, because of how pissed everyone is at the price action and how they have felt the dfinity team has handled things. I'll agree, however, I fear the community is becoming absorbed and not even considering the reality normal small individuals in the US have. Which was the purpose of this blockchain. It wasn't created to become another big tech, big investor project. Yet, it's slowly dividing and could quickly become that. Which will make me and other like me leave... Not stay...

Thank you for your post.  This is not about FUD.  This is about informing the community about the risk taken when not disclosing the maturity to IRS.
I am wondering how this new question will be answered now.  The new keyword is ˋFinancial interestˋ
For me and my tax lawyer firm, Maturity is clearly a Financial Interest in crypto asset.  Make your own interpretation.

Since Dfinity have taken on themselves to make a proposal to avoid the burden of tax, I still wish Dfinity seek a professionnal tax advice report and disclose it to the community in order to protect this community from potential important tax mistakes.

Such a report would help investors to make proper decision as to invest in CF.  It is a big No for me anyway.

As per Forbes recently:

# IRS To Add 87,000 New Agents, More Crypto Tax Enforcement

*For 2022 tax returns, the IRS has modified the crypto question asked on Form 1040. A draft of IRS Form 1040 for 2022 now reads:*

** “At any time during 2022, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award, or compensation); or (b) sell, exchange, gift, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?”*

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2022-08-17 08:43:25 UTC | #63

Yes, exactly. 2022 IMO will be the last tax year US users can safely get away with misrepresentation only if they misreport because of confusion. However, that does not mean that US users could not be fined or taxed on that later. The IRS is in fact cracking down. So, in 2023 or after the next election or possibly mid-terms IMO we may end up getting very direct statements saying you must report all of your maturity gains to the IRS. This will need addressing by the community, and rather quickly or people might panic when the time comes. I completely understand where everyone else is coming from. I voted for the decentralization first just to show my willingness to compromise with the community at large. However, I suggest the community take it into serious thoughtful consideration moving forward. If you think creating or implementing tax optimization is a poor use of time and funds I would argue that may be true for those who are hyper-focused on their own projects. However, it is not the case for smaller investors and new users/ learners. Im blessed with an ability to cover fees for a CPA/ attorney that will help me file this and then represent me if anything occurs. However, there is a large portion of naive investors thinking if you hold and do not sell you do not have to report it, and that is not the case in NYS at the very least. I'm sure some other states might take different stances. However, not in this terrible dumpster fire state. I apologize if this creates new information that the community was unaware of, but trust me I will be taxed on my 20.2% staking rewards in 2022 and then on. Otherwise, the risk of being audited and then possibly having wage garnished to pay back taxes (if you don't have liquid icp or funds to pay fines or fees). It is not just a simple one person wants to file easier. This a serious issue that, IMO if the community does not step up to solve or resolve will be a huge hindrance to the overall IC ecosystem. I know people hate having to work with hyper-regulations like in the USA, but I cannot change that (anytime soon) and this is our reality. I appreciate the safe place to vocalize these concerns and want to make it clear I am not intending on creating FUD or more work or confusion. US users NEED to be better informed, and the community goes silent on them.

I saw in the September R&D session that the community fund has already shipped and is ready to invest in SNS projects. Where can I learn more about this? I wasn't aware it was "live".

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-10-01 08:04:17 UTC | #65

Hi @jzxchiang, a draft implementation of the community fund is now available, but it still undergoes further review & testing. So it is not yet live. 

In terms of getting further information: We have created this [wiki page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Community_Fund), which summarizes the community fund process. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

I have an important question to clarify: is the "maturity" that will be invested automatically from the CF neuron also taken from the "Staked maturity" or is it no longer subject to any investments?
Thanks for your answer :slight_smile:

-------------------------

Severin | 2022-11-18 07:30:48 UTC | #68

AFAIK staked maturity does _not_ get touched by the community fund

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-11-21 09:15:36 UTC | #69

This is correct. Staked maturity becomes available again once the underlying neuron is dissolved. Hence it cannot be exposed to the community fund.

DaveH501 | 2023-03-06 17:24:57 UTC | #73

Sorry if this is the wrong topic to ask this but I have an 8 year neuron with unstaked maturity which is participating in the community fund. My maturity has not been affected by the Openchat launch so I don’t know whether I have contributed to the Community Fund share of the sale or not, or whether I should have done something to do so. I would appreciate any advice on how to manage this neuron going forward to ensure that I am included in the CF investments.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-03-07 00:29:03 UTC | #74

Just make sure the check box is selected for “participate in community fund” in the NNS dApp if you want to participate in the next SNS sale with your unstaked maturity.  You can join and leave the CF any time, but you have to be joined when the SNS sale starts.

DaveH501 | 2023-03-07 09:46:58 UTC | #75

Hi and thank you for the quick reply. The check box to participate in the community fund is checked and has been checked since I spawned the neuron in November, that is what has confused me. My neuron id is### 10454428591714118847 with 6.55 unstaked maturity. There is no record of any contribution but I don’t know whether it would be too small to participate, or any contribution would be so small as to not to notice.

Sorry to bother you with this but I am keen to be part of the fund.

Regards

Dave

From what can be seen on the dashboard, it looks like your neuron is configured to be eligible to participate in a SNS sale as a community fund participant.  However, I suspect you didn't meet the minimum threshold contribution to participate due to some of the other factors that are used to determine all contributions.  Specifically, I suspect your maturity was not enough to make your contribution reach the minimum purchase threshold of 1 ICP.  

There is a lot of maturity available in the community fund and the contribution from each neuron is proportional to the total available maturity in the community fund.  I don't know the exact numbers that were relevant at the time the OpenChat sale started, but here is how I think they apply based on numbers that are publicly available today.  Today there is 3,245,234 maturity available in the community fund.  The OpenChat SNS decentralization sale proposed that 333,333 ICP should be raised from community fund participants.  Hence, in order for a participant to contribute 1 ICP from their maturity, they need to have 9.735 maturity in their neuron today (= 1 * 333333 / 3245234).  I'm sure it was higher when the OpenChat SNS decentralization sale occurred since about 10% of the community fund was consumed with the sale, but hopefully the logic is clear. 

It would be best to get someone like @bjoernek to verify these details. 

I had not studied these numbers previously, but now that I see how smaller participants can be excluded form the SNS decentralization sale, and a highly desirable outcome is decentralization and inclusion of investors of all sizes, I wonder if the participation terms should be modified.  People can join and leave the community fund any time they want it it's their personal responsibility to participate in whichever SNS decentralization sale they want.  Hence, it seems logical to allow every neuron that meets the minimum participation threshold to purchase at that amount.  Then the remainder can be distributed proportional to maturity.  It seems like this algorithm could be a little more inclusive to the smaller neuron owners.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-03-07 13:09:56 UTC | #77

@DaveH501: The analysis by @wpb is spot on. Your neuron is was too small in order to participate via the CF, as per the current logic.

> Hence, it seems logical to allow every neuron that meets the minimum participation threshold to purchase at that amount. Then the remainder can be distributed proportional to maturity.

Yes this is an extension, which we could consider. One further edge case to think about: If an SNS defines a relatively high min investment amount (e.g. 100 ICP). Then for many CF neurons, all of their CF maturity would flow in this particular SNS CF participation. And it is unclear whether this is a desired outcome for these CF neurons.

-------------------------

DaveH501 | 2023-03-07 14:22:03 UTC | #78

Hi and thank you both for your responses.

I do understand the current situation, and by my calculation I should be up to around 10 unstaked maturity within the next 45 days, which should enable my participation in any forthcoming launches.

Thanks again for your help, it is really nice to know that a small investor like myself, with very little knowledge, can get such support and help from ICP developers. Onwards and upwards for ICP and its community, I may even top up my CF neuron to get there more quickly.

Kind Regards,

Dave

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-03-08 03:00:18 UTC | #79

Personally, I think this edge case can be addressed by clear communication of the terms of the sale as well as communication that people can unenroll any time if they believe the price is too high.  It seems worth fleshing out these kinds of details further because maximizing the opportunity for investment by smaller neurons can be a way to help enhance decentralization of the sale.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-03-11 13:09:50 UTC | #80

It seems to me that the CF option is designed to automate the investment process, not to constantly watch if a given SNS will not eat 90% of my maturity in an SNS that has been accepted by whales with a substantial rate and leave every now and then.
I think it's a fund designed for long-term participants who have more money and don't have time to personally check the project and invest (they prefer to trust the community).

However, a nice option would be the ability to add a configurable indicator, e.g. "How much max. percentage of maturity can your neuron invest in a single SNS?" individually for each CF neuron holder.
If a given percentage of the set maturity would meet the minimum participation criteria, then even a neuron with maturity e.g. 1, and setting "permission to include 100% (this percentage would be personally modifiable by the holder) of my maturity in a single CF investment" would participate in such a sale as latest "OpenChat" .

By the way: I suggest that the option "Automatically stake new maturity." DID NOT put maturity from CF investment earnings as "staked maturity". In the future, it should be more configurable for the neuron holder which maturity source adds what kind of maturity.

-------------------------

krzysztofzelazko | 2023-05-06 18:32:59 UTC | #81

Now that the hypotetical neuron has joined the Community Fund, funding SNS from these neuron is done with its un-staked maturity.
I suggest considering an option in which such maturity can also participate, but it would be under the control of the ICP neuron of a given SNS DAPP with max available dissolve delay for passive income (as possibility to implement in every DLaunch).

Hey @bjoernek, @Pete and @diegop it looks like the IC wiki linked above is down.  I’m assuming that wiki would normally have an answer to this question.  I’m looking for specific information about when a person must opt in or opt out of the neuron fund if they want to participate or not participate, respectively, in an SNS token swap.  At what point in time is the snapshot taken regarding which neurons are neuron fund participants for a specific SNS?  Is it when the second SNS proposal is submitted to the NNS?  Is it when the second SNS proposal is executed?  Is it when the token swap opens?  Is it when the token swap ends?  Thanks for your help.  I know this answer exists on the forum somewhere, but I’m having trouble finding it.

Hi @wpb 
The relevant snapshot for participation is taken when the proposal is executed. In particular, during the prior voting period NNS neurons can still opt in & out of the Neurons' Fund. 

The design description of the Neurons' Fund is [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/tokenomics/nns/neurons-fund/#neurons-fund-process).  I think the wiki page was meant to refer to that web page (@diegop might be able to fix this). Thank you for pointing out the broken link.

"If the decentralization swap is not successful, the maturity of NF neurons is increased again by the amount it was decreased by earlier."

Which type of maturity NF neurons increases again by the amount it was previously decreased if the neuron has the 'Automatically stake new maturity.' option enabled? Staked or un-staked?
I mean does this option work for every maturity income or just for voting rewards.

At present, the 'auto_stake_maturity' flag only affects new voting rewards. Considering that Neurons' Fund (NF) neurons contribute with unstaked maturity, it appears reasonable that also unstaked maturity is returned.
