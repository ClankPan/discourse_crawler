I saw Dom go back and forth on Twitter a bit with Solana's founder regarding some inflated TPS numbers on SOL (that apparently were honest mistakes from one of their social media managers or something):

Does anybody know how a direct comparison of the raw TPS on IC compared to SOL currently shakes out? I'm not asking for a comparison of the the quality of the chains and the architecture and the teams, etc. -- just the raw TPS number comparison at the moment.
