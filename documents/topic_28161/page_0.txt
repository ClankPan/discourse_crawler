Hello ICP Community,

We are currently developing a project called Blockbolt on the Internet Computer Blockchain. 

One of the products within this project is an e-commerce website. We aim to provide a service where merchants can host their personal web2 domain to their e-commerce website on a canister.

We have a few questions that we would like to ask for your guidance. 

**Firstly**, how does Canister charge for hosting, both for the front end and back end? 

**Secondly**, is the data hosted on the Canister publicly visible or easily hackable? We would like to ensure that it remains as private as possible, similar to centralized hosting. 

**Lastly**, what would happen if an ICP-hosted domain is under a DDOS attack, and how can we prevent it?

Thank you for your assistance.

Cycles (gas) cost is documented [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost#storage)

Data on ICP is private by default, but it (still) is possible for node providers to access canister memory. I would personally be fine storing data worth a few thousand dollars in canisters unencrypted, but that's just my opinion.

The last question I'll leave for e.g. @rbirkner to answer :slightly_smiling_face:
