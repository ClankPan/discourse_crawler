Scaring for me if it is that easy to login into my NNS.

I totally agree. It's not safe! Also face reconition, is easily to hack. I already suggested on Twitter a NFC personal crypted badge or similar. Don't think they would be able to hack something like that. Think about it ðŸ¤” I should get money for this idea ðŸ˜œ
