I want to assign some access control roles to a canister deployed on the network, is it possible to do that from terminal locally or I will have to create a frontend interface in my project to do that because with candind ui only interface I don't see how that can be possible.

I don't quite understand what you are trying to do. Are you talking about a canister's controllers? Those can be manipulated using `dfx canister update-settings`. Or are you talking about a custom canister? Then you probably have to go through something like CandidUI or `dfx canister call`. But in general I'd expect that it can be done

Yes it's about canister controllers, I want to impliment this access-control system in my project, here, https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/motoko/access-control/, So I want the canister owner to be able to give roles to some principal IDs, locally I am doing that like this according to the tutorial:
```
dfx canister call access_hello assign_role '((principal "Principal_Id_of_someone"),opt variant{admin})'
```
But now I want to do that to a canister that is deployed on the IC newtork., I will then do some logic in the frontend so that people with principal IDs that have admin roles will only have access  to certain services in the project. That's what I want I want to achieve, I don't know if there are other better ways to do that?.

You can call all your canister interface by any agent, for example agentjs and use a nodejs script to do that.

I found the solution, It's this command:
```
dfx canister --network ic call <canister_name> <function_name> <function_input>
```
