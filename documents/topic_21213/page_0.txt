Hello devs! I'm excited to announce a new series of blog posts on the Dev Blog - team spotlight! 

Every two weeks, we're going to be showcasing one of the DFINITY teams to learn what they're working on and dive deeper into how the team fits into the IC ecosystem. Through this new series, developers will get updates and insight into teams other than the SDK and Motoko teams, which are regularly covered on this blog through the 'Developer weekly update' series.

For the first installment of this series, we sat down with the Network Nervous System team to learn more about the NNS, the SNS initiative, and the current goals the team is focused on.
