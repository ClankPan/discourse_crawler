Hello,

I'm trying to deploy my hello world app from Dfinity quick start guide. Both 'npm install' and 'npm start' is giving me an error & I can't really progress to the next steps. Any idea why the terminal is returning these errors? I am using Windows 10 + WSL2 + Ubuntu 20.04 LTS build. 

Screenshot attached for your reference - thanks for your help!

`dfx new` skips the frontend portion if you do not have node.js installed. Please install node.js in your linux subsystem and try again. We recommend Node 14 or 16 for IC development
