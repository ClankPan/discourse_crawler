I tested the new wallet which is accessible from browser and mobile devices. However, several people have asked about a backup solution for if the device or devices are stolen.

What's the current plan for this?

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-11 14:30:06 UTC | #2

If you're talking about the NNS app, then the "backup" would be to just sign in on another device or to use a security key (ex Yubikey, allows you to take your auth keys around with you securely). The NNS/Wallet app is based on DFINITY's "Internet Identity" system, which in turn is based on webauthn. While being more convenient, without using a security key or keeping a session across devices, you have no "password" to later retrieve your account, which can be seen as a downfall of webauthn. 

There is the option of self-custody with DFINITY's keysmith tool, but I haven't used that so I don't know if there's a(n easy) seed/backup solution there.

-------------------------

I have the same question: My devices including my Yubikey get lost. What do I do now? Normally I have a second Yubikey in a secure location but I see no option to save a second one??

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-11 14:55:26 UTC | #4

Try the "signing in from a new device?" option while using your second Yubikey on a different device, this will instruct you on how to link your NNS account access to that second key's identity.

-------------------------

benbasic | 2021-05-11 14:58:36 UTC | #5

so I just need a second Mac from a friend? :upside_down_face:
Is it device-independent as long as the Yubikey is unique? So could I just use my Yubikey on another device to log in? I thought the device itself is also linked to the account

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-11 15:00:50 UTC | #6

I believe so. The device may temporarily store some credentials but everything should be derived directly from the key. It also doesn't have to be a desktop, if your phone supports your key then you could also try that.

-------------------------

benbasic | 2021-05-11 15:07:21 UTC | #7

This should also mean that using my FaceID on the Phone should work on any phone which is linked to my iCloud?

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-11 15:11:22 UTC | #8

The convenience is good but that's a hell of a downfall. I know numerous people who lose phones or laptops. With passwords and pass phrases (crypto) they keep a record somewhere. Yubikeys are not common (yet) and are easily lost or stolen.

If e.g. an Apple device is used, will a new apple device be able to get access or is this completely tied to the specific hardware?

Perhaps a recovery system could be developed whereby 3rd parties can work together to give you access again? Then it'd be a natural service to offer.

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-11 15:24:47 UTC | #9

@benbasic @sillytuna to my knowledge, no, iCloud/apple devices do not sync webauthn, and I don't expect them to as that could be a potential security risk (the magic of webauthn lies in your keys being unique and verifiable to that user only). Also commenting on a "backup system," that again would be impossible as your private keys would have to be exposed to the app (if your device uses software-based key management, it is possible to get the keys, but that destroys their veritability). While I'd love to see a system like that, at the moment it's just not feasible.

-------------------------

jfw1987 | 2021-05-11 16:21:29 UTC | #10

So there's no recovery method at all? This is a major flaw to adoption. The vision Dfinity have been pushing is of a "poor but talented developer Nigeria can launch an internet company with just a basic laptop". But now they need a $50 Yubikey and an expensive smartphone with biometrics just to have two devices. It might seem like a nice idea in the west coast tech world but in the real world it is a barrier which will harm Dfinity. I will not be storing and locking up my coins on the NNS if there's a risk I lose them all if I lose my phone.

-------------------------

ililic | 2021-05-11 16:24:26 UTC | #11

Hey folks, 

I would chime in here to add that we're working on hardware wallet support. It's high priority and on the way, though the independent review process is out of our hands.

Please take a look at our [support documentation](https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us/articles/360057133012-What-is-self-custody-) for self custody best practices.

BeckyLU | 2021-05-11 16:25:29 UTC | #12

How to send ICP to my NNS app from an air-gapped computer?

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-11 16:40:50 UTC | #13

So yes, there are some barriers and the implementation is novel, however I'd like to note that even most budget smartphones have biometrics. Also, this is a flaw with webauthn (a w3c standard), not DFINITY (although it is their responsibility for choosing webauthn), and I'm with you that it's annoying, but I think we should have patience, as there are more options coming soon. Please note that there are also software implementations of webauthn if you want free redundancy.

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-05-11 16:44:53 UTC | #14

So there is a method or not?

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-11 19:10:15 UTC | #15

There is no method. Livelyx, what kind of solutions could dfinity design that can work for normies do you think? Even if it means protocol changes.

(Hardware wallets, yubi keys etc are not the solution - they need their phone to back up to icloud for example, or some other recover system)

-------------------------

kpeacock | 2021-05-11 20:01:40 UTC | #16

At launch, the recovery strategy is to link as many devices as you have available. I have personally registered:

- Android screen unlock
- Work Yubikey
- Personal Yubikey
- Mac TouchId

As independent strategies. The Yubikey is portable, and I can use it on a new device or browser if I choose. If I ever lose control of a device, I can go to the manage-devices section after logging in, and I can remove access from the lost device.

We do have ideas about how to offer advanced support for lost access, but we targeted a small and highly secure strategy. 

As for the iCloud - @livelyx is correct. The devices are independent and cannot be used interchangeably.

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-05-11 21:21:47 UTC | #17

Lol I live in Nigeria...smartphones are not a big deal here at all. Trust me, things are actually not as bleak in 3rd world countries like they tell you.
You can get a good Android smartphone here for around USD40. Even a student can afford that here. The NNS doesn't necessarily need face or fingerprint unlock either. Your screen unlock pin works just fine.

That doesn't stop the team from thinking about a less risky but secure key management though.

-------------------------

flyq | 2021-05-12 07:05:52 UTC | #18

I just withdrew a few ICPs from Binance to experience the entire system.
As a crypto practitioner, the entire user experience is really great.

1. There is no need to back up the private key, and the private key will never be exposed because they are stored in the security chip inside the device (which may be similar to the concept of TEE hardware), reducing the risk of leakage.
2. I registered my laptop and mobile phone, and I believe in the level of the security chip of these two devices. Both devices can independently have all the permissions of this account, this has actually reached the traditional sense of wallet backups. It is very unlikely that they will be broken or lost at the same time. Therefore, the probability of loss is very low. If you think it is not enough, you can buy more equipment.
3. Even if I lose my mobile phone/computer, but without my biological characteristics, ICP is still safe. Once the device is lost, it is necessary to ensure that the data cannot be leaked.
4. Risks always exist. Metamask may have bugs, ledger hardware wallet may have bugs, and even credit cards/PayPal may be stolen. Before becoming a billionaire and being targeted by hackers, these security measures are sufficient. :wink:

I am using an old iPhone fully updated with just finger print auth. Storing it in my fire proof safe. Seems good enough for now.

May need to invest in one of these yubikey things for pc usage.

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-12 13:05:47 UTC | #20

I think many were frustrated with the concept of having to own a second device. I agree that it's very unlikely for both devices to get lost/stolen/broken at the same time, but with traditional wallets you can use the same seed anywhere (no need for a "backup device"), and you can export it anywhere (like paper or somewhere else safe), webauthn doesn't allow this.

I haven't looked in-depth into how the IC uses the webauthn APIs for it's identity service, but I believe there may be a possibility for some kind of "identity seed," don't quote me on that though.

@livelyx @kpeacock

 can you confirm whether a single yubikey can be used to log in on any device? Or whether a yubikey is tied to only authorizing login to a single device? Thank you


Also, whether a second yubikey registration requires a different device but then once registered can be used on any device? Or if the second yubikey can be registered on the same device the first yubikey was registered on.

-------------------------

livelyx | 2021-05-12 13:58:21 UTC | #22

It's portable, your "internet identity" is stored on these keys, not the computer you're using. The reason why you need another device for another key is because the first device has to confirm the second device in the browser, after that you should be able to hot swap. You may get away with just using multiple browsers at once, however I don't have multiple keys so I haven't tested this (would require your browser to let you select which key you want to use).

[/quote]

Yes, I can confirm. Once you "activated" the Yubikey you can use it on any device as long as you have your account number.

vassrini | 2021-05-12 16:15:30 UTC | #24

Using Ledger FIDO U2F app which is equivalent to Yubikey to access internet identity ( which is associated with a ICP address)  is a workaround until native ledger support is available.

-------------------------

criptoslav | 2021-05-14 09:46:46 UTC | #25

Actually I added new device using just lock screen on my backup Android phone, so basically just 4 number pin :smile: not super safe, but at least I have backup device, originaly created identity on my iPhone, will need to get Yubikey or update my MacBook pro.

-------------------------

johansten | 2021-05-15 06:06:27 UTC | #26

Hardware keys are really good for day-to-day security, but for anything else you can't beat a seed phrase. Especially for a project with a 20+ year road map, this seems like a very myopic solution. People will die, and ICPs will get lost because of this.

I take my estate planning rather seriously. My closest relatives are on the other side of the world. The best I've found so far for ICP is FIDO U2F on a Ledger, using the Ledger seed phrase. But that also means I need to buy and ship them a Ledger that's completely unnecessary for anything else.

-------------------------

Chris | 2021-05-15 07:02:52 UTC | #27

That is precisely what I did.

fojo95 | 2021-05-15 07:36:34 UTC | #28

I like the fact that Dfinity takes a secure-by-default approach. Remember the early days of Ethereum when everyone just created their key pair on MyEtherWallet and got hacked or lost it so easily.

And when hardware wallet support is here, you can just use the recovery seed from that device.

-------------------------

sillytuna | 2021-05-15 08:06:08 UTC | #29

It's fine for now but a recovery process is extremely important for mainstreaming. I'm not saying passphrases or raw keys are the answer (nor possible in this case) but there could be some process of multifactor recovery in the works.

Many people don't have second devices, and certainly not ones that are trustworthy. It's easy to forget that for most people none of their devices are particularly secure from family or even work colleagues, and a second device, usually a computer, is commonly used by multiple people in a family.

If a recovery system involved m of n other devices working together and a time lock then that would work, also because companies could offer it as a service (they could be m factors but you could have more). At the moment backup devices are all or nothing, and a single device has permission to do anything.

The same process could also lock an account if hardware was stolen to prevent theft before recovery. This would be good even for the more techie people here. Essentially what we're after is the core wallet software to be more like gnosis safe.

Is this possible with the tech, subject to some system changes of course?

-------------------------

tlbalog | 2021-05-25 07:15:21 UTC | #30

Important point there.

So far, we haven't heard of anyone losing their wallet to hackers so far, and that's because private keys are not involved in the wallet creation. That just proves that private keys are bad for the masses. This is what the MyCrypto team have been hammering for many years.

It's now left for everyone to keep their (newly introduced) recovery seed safe.
And if you think the seed words method is too risky, you can simply create a recovery hardware key.

-------------------------

kritzcreek | 2021-05-25 08:15:03 UTC | #31

To anyone in this thread that hasn't seen the news yet:
https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1396540426694266880

We've added the ability to generate a Seed Phrase as a recovery mechanism or use an extra security key (recommended).

These recovery options will _not_ work as authenticators for day-to-day logging in, but you can use them to add/remove other registered devices. We decided this strikes a good balance between securing users accounts and protecting our users from being hacked by exposing their passwords/seed phrases.

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-05-25 14:08:29 UTC | #32

Thank you, it's a great progress.

I have backed up my seed phrases, however, when I try to test recovery function on nns.app, it says 
"Failed to recover
You do not have any recovery devices configured. Did you mean to login with one of your devices instead?"

So where can I use the seed phrases if I lost access to my wallet? What's the recovery configuration on nns.app?

kritzcreek | 2021-05-25 15:38:04 UTC | #33

Did you create said seed phrase in the Internet Identity UI? This is not related to whatever mechanism was used to give Neurons to the seed investors.

If you did, that looks like a bug. Could you send a message detailing what happened to https://support.dfinity.org/hc/en-us in that case?

-------------------------

BeckyLU | 2021-05-25 18:45:59 UTC | #34

Yeah the seed phrases are got from Internet Identity UI. 
I created my identity on nns.app, got the warning to set up recovery when login.

Have submitted the ticket, thank you.

Hi!
Please tell me how to re-generate a seed phrase on a mobile device? 
I was unable to record the phrase the first time. Thank you!!!

-------------------------

I was able to log in, remove the seed phrase like I was removing a device, and then generate a new one.
