Conversion of maturity -- if this becomes a feature of the proposal -- would be a manual event. What would the difference between automatically doing it, and accumulating the maturity as compounding in the first place?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-08 18:08:24 UTC | #106

It is very likely not going to be a part of the SNS in its first release.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-08 18:09:25 UTC | #107

Yes, you will always be able to retrieve "liquid maturity" as soon as it is represents more than 1 ICP in value. In order to preserve this freedom, you would NOT enable the compounding maturity flag on your neuron.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-02-08 18:10:18 UTC | #108

Indeed, the auto-compounded maturity, which treats maturity as a kind of virtual stake, would be entirely opt-in. The current maturity scheme, as it stands, would still remain.

dfisher | 2022-02-09 04:53:04 UTC | #111

Hmm you are definitely right that it definitely would cause a lot of additional anxiety at the point of disbursal. And we are supposed to use it in the ICP ecosystem. This proposal is certainly a headscratcher !!!

If anything we want to incentivise spending ICP in the ecosystem as much as locking up ICP via staking. The ICP ecosystem will not grow with out increased "spending" The suggested changes do not address the issue of "spending" ICP in any way so I think they need to be reworked with that in mind.

Something that should worry everyone at this point is inflation more than tax advantages, Kyle Langham estimates that a price around $3 is very dangerous because it could produce an inflation death spiral. If we're entering a bear market and BTC has a few more dumps to take we're going to be very close to that price range. For the sake of the whole network a dynamic APY or some other solution would have to be implemented in that case anyway, even if a death spiral doesn't happen inflation will get out of control. Maybe a reduced ICP reward can translate into community fund rewards, let's say we get larger community project token allocations or through some other advantage that will mean a big reward once the network gets out of the hole it fell in.
If the concern is the arbitrariness of the APY we can just make APY a function of price, less price translates to less APY, as price "normalizes" so will APY go back up to where it would be.

-------------------------

tsetse | 2022-03-08 04:27:27 UTC | #116

APY is not the main reason why the $3 price could mark the beginning of a death spiral in Langham's analysis. Because the total amount of ICP produced through APY is not a function of ICP's price. The problem lies with node rewards which are paid in fiat-equivalent ICP. Therefore, the lower the ICP price, the more ICP needs to be minting to pay node providers. If the network keeps expanding and price keeps falling, it could lead to an inflationary spiral that can only be stopped by curtailing the number of nodes, which itself would be a huge setback.
I do agree that long-term inflation is an issue and it would be good if Dfinity finds ways to curb it.

Death spiral would be stopped with a well funded and diversified Dfinity Treasury. Each month, additional ICP could be minted and converted to stable coins. This stable coin treasury should be used to be node providers if ICP price goes below a danger threshold. Stable coin emergency treasury should increase or decrease as a function of the risk to reach the threshold. mmm... actually this could be a governance proposal.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-03-08 14:52:03 UTC | #118

Also important to consider that the more nodes we have the more cycles we can potentially burn. Cycle burn should offset node provider rewards, so I don't see where the inflationary death spiral would happen if nodes are always burning more cycles than they're receiving in equivalent ICP. Of course we have to switched over to the fully automatic renumeration yet. Does anyone have insights on this part of the inflation equation?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-03-15 11:30:41 UTC | #120

I may be wrong, but I believe there is a long list of nodes that have been on standby since genesis.  I don’t think node providers would invest in equipment to be on standby without getting paid.  Therefore, I suspect deploying new nodes will not cost more than what is already getting paid out.  This is my assumption.  I don’t know this as a fact.

Great question. I heard about the IDL nodes. One of the team members confirmed we have ~800 nodes on IDL, just waiting to join the network: [see:@Luis-comments](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/the-state-and-direction-of-decentralization-nodes-on-the-internet-computer/9170/68?u=llbrunoll). 

Question: Are those 800 IDL nodes being rewarded?

(in case Yes: Onboarding those new nodes will be fine. In case 'no' + 'ICP price goes <5 $USD' Onboarding new nodes might be a problem regarding inflationary pressure along 2022-2023.) 

I hope someone could clarify about that. @Luis

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-05-01 09:03:17 UTC | #125

Why/how would they be rewarded if they arent on the network and contributing to the protocol?

-------------------------

llbrunoll | 2022-05-02 00:34:55 UTC | #126

Hi @JaMarco , that is a relevant point, and it is why I am curios about that. To know if the IDL nodes are being rewarded or not.

For nodes to be IDL -and 'ready to connect to the network'- it would mean that: 

i) the nodes are already bought (a large sum of money is vested in hardware that is currently IDL.)

ii) If the nodes are ready to join the network, it means that they are deployed in a Data Center. Those nodes providers are already paying stack rent/fees and probably already paying for secure/high-speed connections made available to them. And still, they are IDL. 

If it is the case that Dfinity decides to keep them IDL, them -maybe- there might be a compensation.

Yes, all nodes from the initial set of node providers are rewarded from the point in time where the node provider proved that they are racked and stacked. For the initial set of nodes this was the only way to convince node providers to invest. Just as a reminder, the thousands of interested node providers came after launch. Before launch you needed to be very brave to invest in something that sounds undoable and doesn't exist yet :slight_smile: 
We will know better at the end of this year, but it already looks like we estimated the number of needed nodes for the first 18 month very well. It gave us enough capacity and time to develop the operational maturity that is needed to grow into the millions of nodes (if needed).

Operational maturity to support millions of nodes is definitely one angle. However the most important angle is : what would we do with millions of nodes?



 Currently we are not using even 10% of installed capacity (all of 500 nodes). So our plan was to grow a 1000 fold in compute capacity over the next couple of years. Currently we ARE NOT EVEN CLOSE in demanding a 1000 fold increase in capacity. So why are we not actively changing our plan in response to the business?

Edit: i.e. virtually all such hosting contracts have an contingency built in..."if we are unable to use these nodes in a timely fashion because of business reasons, we reserve the right to terminate such nodes...."...if you do, investigate whether we need to execute that clause.

ray | 2022-05-02 12:07:26 UTC | #129

Well the problem is nobody uses the network. You dont need many nodes. You dont need many blocks per second. I am not seeing any kind of development on the IC that would suggest that dapps, projects are launching on the chain. like zero. The only number that maters is how much ICP gets currently burned. vs. currently minted. the divergence between these numbers is astronomical. 

So before making complicated solutions like a treasury or what not, just get the fucking number up of apps and people that use this ghost chain. After that decentralizing the nodes is a must too. 

Besides that I disagree on Dominics proposal regarding governance staking and tax. totaly disagree.
He should also stop shitting on other projects (its partially a reason why nobody uses the IC) and deliver the product we have been waiting for for years.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-05-02 12:13:28 UTC | #130

Relax. ICP is barely a year old.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2022-05-02 12:16:11 UTC | #131

Markets are currently crashing and people are "losing" a lot of money so tensions are high right now. That's why we've been seeing these meltdowns on the forum.

I tried to explain that in my previous post, but perhaps it needs more background. 

Let say your team needs to start a decentralized network like it was never done before. You have some calculations verified on different hardware with different real world emulations. The teams have a feeling how the protocol components will work. The community has some initial docs and papers allowing them to develop and deploy also in a relatively new way. 
How do you want to get your platform up? How will the demand relate to the protocol efficiency? How much nodes should be provided at what time? What if we need 1000 nodes a year after launch? Or 2000? What will happen beyond what was emulated before launch? How much time do we need/have for preparation?
You need to do some estimations. You need to implement controls that ensure a stable network with the given resources. This includes human resources. You need to setup rollout plans that can respond to changing factors like delays in the HW supply and service interruptions due to a pandemic, or operational findings because no one did it like that before and other known unknowns. 
On the end to need to have a plan that convinces enough node providers to invest in nodes and prepare them to a level that allows any easy onboarding to the network. 
"Contributing to the network" thereby only means that the nodes can be added to the initial network at any time. Technically "contributing to the network" means that a node is assigned to a subnet. Spare nodes which are existential for the network are technically not contributing although they have a node ID in the registry. Nodes can have many levels of contribution when building up a platform. You can't rely on finding the right node provider at the right time and location accepting the right rewards.  
The new NP onboarding process only pays rewards for technically contributing nodes. There is no need to  prepare full racks around the world. We can onboard what the network needs, or better, what a growth strategy is asking for.

What makes you think that? I don't think the network will grow to a million nodes if they aren't needed. But you should be prepared for that if that's your goal, right?

Where do these numbers come from? How much resources are you reserving to ensure a stable network? Are you counting spare nodes or only contributing nodes? How much reserve do you need in a network following a byzantine redundancy that is granulated in subnets? How confident are you with how the protocol efficiency is improving? What do you know about the impact on the network utilisation of upcoming features? Which business plan was changed?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-05-02 15:55:33 UTC | #136

The following is the basis for my assertion of less than 10% of compute capacity is being used. Please let me know which assumptions could be invalid / which calcs are wrong/misleading. 

1. Current ICP provided to NPs: 100,000 /month
2. Current cycle burn rate : 5 B/s = 432 T cycles / day = 13000 T cycles / month
3. Current ICP Conversation Rate: 9.5 T cycles
4. Max ICP Burnt / month FOR cycle consumption: 13000 / 9.5 = 1400 ICP
5. Average nodes per subnet does not exceed 40. Therefore a 75% reserve should be adequate.

Comments: 

C1. The estimate of 1400 ICP /Month for compute cycles is almost assuredly way too high. But let's leave it at that.

C2. We are not utilizing more than half of the provisioned compute capacity ( 500 nodes / 1300 nodes). 

C3. We should be paying node providers for compute capacity that they provide. Let's assume that only 25% is effective utilization (accounting for reserve capacity)..i.e. 25000 icp out of 100000 icp.

So 1400 / 25000 = 5.6 % ( less than 10%) of current capacity of 500 nodes is being used AT MAX.

Happy to be challenged or look at alternate methods of calculating. 

However if these numbers are even remotely close, what apps are going to cause a 1000 fold increase in capacity spend(millions of nodes) over next two years ; given that this plan was in place pre-launc

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2022-05-02 16:11:51 UTC | #137

It's understandable. Twitter and ICP trader is probably a better place for venting about price performance.

-------------------------

Luis | 2022-05-02 16:17:49 UTC | #138

Average nodes per subnet is way below 40. 
Where is the total compute capacity? 

Do you understand that we won't use the full capacity on purpose? 
Do understand why we can't see the current capacity as an over capacity just because it isn't technically contributing to a subnet?  
Beside that you're now bringing numbers up that need a further understanding e.g. the burn rate only reflects the currently implemented fees. 

Our research team is working on a white paper that explains the different price finding models that we could follow in the future. For now I would recommend you to see the over capacity or over rewarding as a subsidy to build up the initial network.

I guess that question is easy to answer if you know what's currently running on the IC. The vast majority of apps isn't yet running on the IC. Beside that the number of apps and utilisation per app are two different things with the same result - more load. 
I'm open to discuss improvements in the node rewarding but for the initial set of nodes every calculation is correct that allows us to establish the IC with a stable platform. It's just about adjusting reserves and timeline to gather more data with more projects starting on the IC. Patience pays out here.

so, I am trying to track down how to calculate the daily rewards given over the course of the year for the 8-year stake. For example, say I have 50 staked for 8 years, and every day I vote and receive the rewards. As things stand right now (using the NNS front end) are we expected to leave the rewards untouched (un-merged/spawned) until the end of the year and then calculate it ourselves? or are we supposed to take the initial stake from our account balance sheet, then subtract the merged rewards given at the end of the year to get a number for any forms. This might be more complicated... I did read the medium post... I just am trying to get an idea of what to do/ am responsible for declaring to IRS, or if they currently have it laid out to bypass any taxation until the sale of the entire dissolved neuron over the 8-year time? I am fairly new to this so please bear with me... I just want to maximize my voting rewards while also being mindful of how to properly declare it this coming tax season (2022)
