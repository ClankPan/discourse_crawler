Hello fellow nerds,

I'd like to introduce to you what I called the "Carlson Protocol": it is a decentralized decision system where people vote using ckBTC. These ckBTC are transferred back to the user after a period of time that can vary according to specific rules. When reimbursed, users get rewarded with additional tokens that depend on how their past vote aligns with the current view.

‚ú® **The Carlson Protocol leverages how much people care**. If you don't care enough about a vote, you will find better usage for your bitcoins elsewhere.

‚öîÔ∏è **The Carlson Protocol is a double-edged sword**. The more bitcoins you lock in a vote, the greater your voice, but the lesser the reward and the longer your bitcoins will stay locked.

üóΩ **The Carlson Protocol is stateless**. Votes never end, and results decay. Even the most one-sided votes will decay over time, offering the opportunity to reevaluate past consensus.

üí™ **The Carlson Protocol rewards the bold**. Stand for your beliefs against the crowd. If the future proves you right, you will be rewarded.

I already started a POC [here](https://github.com/sardariuss/carlson_protocol). 

I'd like to have your opinion on it: is it something that you think can have a utility, or do you see any major flaw in the design. Maybe people from Factland might be interested (@kaxline), since I think it's a bit similar to how Factland works (but stateless).

Thank you!

It's really great that you keep re-improving the design ideas
