While doing a demo of my new side project my local replica began to crash (üò¨) and the issue according stacktracke does not seem linked to my code. Any clue what's happening and why I land in that state?

Gonna link also my other issue https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-start-endless-loop/17952/2. Maybe something weird on M2?

Seems like we need to increase the number of max open files in the OS:
```
launchctl limit maxfiles
sudo launchctl limit maxfiles <new soft limit> <new hard limit>
```

`launchctl limit maxfiles`

Thanks for the answer. I assume you would like me to run the command line right? So here the results:

^^^ below is also the command to increase the limits.

I'll clean my local state and deploy again. If I hit the issue again, will increase the value, thanks for the answer!

cryptoschindler | 2023-02-20 08:16:33 UTC | #7

I've run into this regularly as well, but never had the problem before 0.12.1. I guess this due to a change/bug in dfx?

-------------------------

berestovskyy | 2023-02-21 22:14:50 UTC | #8

It's a global limit on open files, and all the running applications and active users contribute there.

Also, the `dfx` might be using more open files if there are more running canisters. So it might be not the `dfx` per ce, but just the project got bigger...

Anyway, there is `lsof` command to check which files are currently open by which application/user. If the `dfx` is indeed doing something unexpected, please let us know.

Hit this error again right when it should not have happened because I needed my current state to test a migration ü•≤.

Anyhow, bumped the number of open files, same stuffs, does not work.

Had

Bumped to

Still got

I removed this whole dir here `File system error for file /Users/cyberowl/Library/Application Support/org.dfinity.dfx ` and then did `sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"`. Moved it to desktop in case I need it but so far seems fine.

Hi, i'm facing the same issue, any update on this ?
On macbookpro with intel chip, 16gb ram, and with launchctl limit maxfiles

	maxfiles    256            unlimited

This time got the feeling I landed here because I made too many installation of canisters in parallel.

stefan.schneider | 2024-04-16 11:18:06 UTC | #13

What does `ulimit -n` say? And have you tried `ulimit -n unlimited` in the console before `dfx start`?

-------------------------

peterparker | 2024-04-16 12:19:56 UTC | #14

I have deleted the states few times and ultimately deployed less canisters. I'll try your tips next time it happens again, thx.
