Hi everyone, 

One of the part of our grant from Dfinity, was exploring a solutions for canisters upkeep. I've created a simple site that can be used to top up any canister with cycles. Anyone that knows the canister id can connect their wallet (for now plug, byt ii, stoic and infinity wallet are coming) enter canister id, specify ICP amount and top up canister.

The website is available here: http://ictopup.com/ or https://oncq2-raaaa-aaaah-qc22q-cai.ic0.app/
The code for the website: https://github.com/gigaverselabs/topup_site

I have some plans on further development of this site, however the idea is to keep it simple.
