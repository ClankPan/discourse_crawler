The NNS Team will be submitting the following upgrade proposals this Tuesday, 2023-11-21.  DFINITY plans to vote on these proposals early morning Zurich the next day.

## Hot Fix for NNS Governance Incident

Due to an issue with a release on Monday, November 20th, heartbeats ran out of cycles. To fix this, we rolled back to the previously deployed version of Governance.

However, today it was found that there was an additional issue where the Neuron Spawning lock was never released, thereby preventing neurons from spawning.  Additionally, one neuron had an unreleased neuron lock.

We were able to verify that this issue did not leave neurons and ledger transactions in an inconsistent state.

We are now releasing a patch to the currently deployed version that releases the locks on spawning and the single neuron affected with a neuron lock.

This change (in post_upgrade) will not be merged back into the main branch, as it does not need to execute more than one time.

The hotfix branch (mentioned in the proposal) will be mirrored as soon as possible to Github for verification.

## Hotfix
An upgrade proposal on Nov 20 caused NNS Governance heartbeats to hit the instruction limit.  After rolling this back, it was discovered that some neurons were not able to finish spawning. The issue in heartbeats created a permanent lock on spawning, and caused one neuron to be locked.  After investigating, all neurons were shown to have correct values, meaning it is safe to rest the Neuron Spawning lock and to unlock the single affected neuron.

This release only patches the currently deployed version of NNS Governance (which was rolled back to late November 20th), and does not contain other changes.

This release is built from branch hotfix-no-rc--nns-2023-11-20, and these changes will not be merged back into the master branch, as they only need to be executed once.

Hi all, quick update from our side: this proposal has been adopted and the two issues were resolved:
1. The Neuron Spawning lock was released, so neurons can be spawning again. 
2. The neuron with an unreleased neuron lock got this lock released.
