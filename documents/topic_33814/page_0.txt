Hi all DFINITY forum members, Josip here from [ICP HUB BULGARIA](https://twitter.com/icphub_BG)!

This is a proposal to create a Known Neuron from our Hub for the Balkan community members.

ICP HUB Bulgaria was established in September 2023 and since then created a fully dedicated team for incubating, proliferation and education of ICP within the Bulgaria Region. Some of the Key Details:

* 35+ Events Organized (Workshops, Ideathons, Business Mixers)

* [ICP x Burgas 2 Day Workshop](https://medium.com/@icpbalkans/icp-burgas-workshop-recap-two-days-of-innovation-and-learning-44249725106b)
* [ICP x Moonstruck - Belgrade Blockchain Week ](https://medium.com/@icpbalkans/event-recap-icp-hub-bulgaria-x-moonstruck-at-belgrade-blockchain-week-1dcd6bc8dde4)
* [ICP x Locastic - Blocksplit & many others.
](https://medium.com/@icpbalkans/icp-x-locastic-at-blocksplit-an-evening-of-crypto-connections-and-cocktails-bf97eedcde11)

* 40+ Partnerships established across the Balkan region with renowned partners.

* Established a community of more than 1000+ active community members across the region together with ICP BULGARIA Community.

* Onboarded more than 25+ Development Shops across the region to start actively working and building upon the IC ecosystem.

* [4.0 Venture Labs](https://4pto.io/) | [Moonstruck](https://moonstruck.io/) | [RubyCode
](https://rubycode.co/)

* Incubated and Launched a wide range of projects, with a specific focus on DeAI and Chain Fusion:

* [ckSOL (Galactic Bridge)](https://weichain.gitbook.io/galactic-bridge) → [Announcement Info](https://medium.com/@icpbalkans/introducing-cksol-through-the-galactic-bridge-presented-by-icp-hub-balkan-eb87f6d7e5d0)
* [ckSUI (MOST Bridge)](https://explorer.most-bridge.org/) → [Announcement Info](https://beincrypto.com/introducing-most-icp-x-sui-bridge-using-chain-fusion/?__cf_chl_rt_tk=nLyMav1NSr53rPFG4nyDqzbXaUxMgEimbgn_RCnVu6c-1721818479-0.0.1.1-7166)
* [Datapond](https://datapond.ai/) → [Announcement Info](https://medium.com/@icpbalkans/datapond-x-icp-hub-balkan-advancing-ai-blockchain-integrations-d1f0d04eda29)

We are a team which coordinates all the efforts within Bulgaria and the Balkans region, ensuring the proliferation and further development of the ICP ecosystem.

Team behind this proposal:

* [Josip Vlah (Hub Lead) ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vlahjosip/)
* [Filip Brzica (COO) ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipbrzica/)
* [Boyan Klisurov (Technical Lead / Founder of ICP Community Bulgaria) ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyan-klisurov-731a55184/)
* [Ranko Gajanovic (Marketing / Community Lead) ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranko-gajanovic/)

And many other friends and colleagues.

Why do we wish to create a known neuron?

Over the past year, we have established significant partnerships across a wide range of projects, development shops, and communities in Central and Eastern Europe. These partnerships were made possible through the use of Chain-Key Technology, DeAI, and other technical elements that the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is recognized for.

Given this progress, we have built a robust network and aspire to become a leading voice within this network in the region, specifically focusing on Bulgaria and the broader Balkans. This proposal aims to establish a strong foundation for current and future participants in the Network Nervous System (NNS) within the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region.

What topics do we wish to cover?

Initially, we will focus on topics related to the SNS & Neurons Fund. As our team grows, we plan to delve deeper into various subjects covered by the NNS, such as the IC OS Version Election, Protocol Canister Management, and more. Over time, we will broaden our expertise in additional specific areas and keep the community informed on these developments regularly.

Our primary objective is to balance community decentralization with active neuron voting on complex technical governance topics. This will be achieved through collaboration with carefully selected experts in the field.

Neuron Control

Currently, the neuron will be managed by Josip Vlah, the Hub Lead, and Boyan Klisurov, who serves as the Technical Lead.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Gm, as someone who has been deeply involved within the Web3 space for the past 5+ years in the Balkans region and broader Europe, I wholeheartedly support this initiative to create a Known Neuron.

The Hub definitely put ICP on the map of strong projects within the blockchain field in the region. With the established partnerships and network, it is clear that creating a Known Neuron from ICP HUB BULGARIA will ensure active participation and informed decision-making within the NNS.

It is important to also note that the region is experiencing rapid growth in the tech field, and a lot of quality Web3 projects have already emerged, surviving multiple cycles and continuing to build beyond the hype. Having an entity that actively participates in governance, builds community trust on the ground, and serves as a source of education will enhance overall governance and contribute to decentralization. It will also engage the community, build more credibility, and advocate for the interests of the broader community.

This initiative will provide more reasons for Web3 projects, startups, and even Web2 projects to trust ICP as a blockchain that makes sound decisions. This is crucial when deciding which chain to utilize, beyond just the technical infrastructure.

Salut Josip and ICP BG Hub!

It is worth adding that the ICP Hub Bulgaria neuron has Neuron ID 1100477100620240869. The proposal to register this known neuron will be submitted to the NNS next Monday.

Warmest regards,

Krzysztof Żelazko
Governance Lead, ICP Hub Poland
