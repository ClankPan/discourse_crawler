# IC-OS Verification

To build and verify the IC-OS disk image, run:

```
# From https://github.com/dfinity/ic#verifying-releases
sudo apt-get install -y curl && curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dfinity/ic/48da85ee6c03e8c15f3e90b21bf9ccae7b753ee6/gitlab-ci/tools/repro-check.sh && chmod +x repro-check.sh && ./repro-check.sh -c 48da85ee6c03e8c15f3e90b21bf9ccae7b753ee6
```

The two SHA256 sums printed above from a) the downloaded CDN image and b) the locally built image, must be identical, and must match the SHA256 from the payload of the NNS proposal.

This week we also have a feature build that enables p2p! The proposal link is: https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128155

The CodeGov neuron has voted to Adopt both proposals 128154 and 128155.  Our reviews are still coming in, but here is the link to our [reviews for proposal 128154](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/54) for anyone who is interested in knowing what our reviewers have to say.  I will post a summary later this evening after our review period is complete.

Reviewers for the CodeGov project have completed our review of these replica updates.

Proposal ID: **128154**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov community Replica Version Management Reviews channel on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/54) 

Proposal ID: **128155**
Vote: **ADOPT**
Full report: [CodeGov community Replica Version Management Reviews channel on OpenChat](https://oc.app/community/32l35-yaaaa-aaaar-aw57q-cai/channel/78010556105983937984590438937075688039/55) 

At the time of this comment on the forum there are still 2 days left in the voting period, which means there is still plenty of time for others to review the proposal and vote independently.  

We had several very good reviews of the Release Notes on these proposals by @Zane, @cyberowl, @ZackDS, @massimoalbarello, @Gekctek, and @hpeebles.  The IC-OS Verification was also performed by @ilbert and @tiago89.  I recommend folks talk a look and see the excellent work that was performed on these reviews by the entire CodeGov team.  Feel free to comment here or in the thread of each respective proposal in our community on OpenChat if you have any questions or suggestions about these reviews.

Hello everybody, 

This is Rosti from the networking team. 

For this week feature rollout I would suggest electing a new replica version that doesn't contain [2217c3ed9] (https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/2217c3ed9b57e9a63a66c7e280a5f7db43f10cdb)  and [224d7c73a86] (https://github.com/dfinity/ic/commit/224d7c73a86db4b1ea3230532e1e2fef60dcb563).

In our efforts to have as little interaction between the old and new P2P layer, we ended up in situation where we run both implementations together. This doesn't introduce any risk at all for the protocol. However, we would prefer to have clean state as soon as possible so we can monitor the new P2P layer for longer period of time.

On my behalf i apologize for the inconvenience.

A new proposal is out, as announced by @rumenov:

https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/128171

It's fairly short, only contains 2 reverts. So hopefully should be quick and easy for the CodeGov team to review.

The Followees for the CodeGov neuron have reached consensus on this proposal and voted to Adopt.
