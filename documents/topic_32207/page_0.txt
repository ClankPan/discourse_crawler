I am developing a canister that creates other canisters and I want to test it. Is there a way to retrieve using dfx the canister Ids of all canisters running in my local replica?

Not really with dfx. This is probably the most pragmatic way, although this only lists canisters in your project:
```bash
‚ùØ cat .dfx/local/canister_ids.json
{
  "__Candid_UI": {
    "local": "be2us-64aaa-aaaaa-qaabq-cai"
  },
  "hello_backend": {
    "local": "bkyz2-fmaaa-aaaaa-qaaaq-cai"
  },
  "hello_frontend": {
    "local": "bd3sg-teaaa-aaaaa-qaaba-cai"
  }
}%  
```

If you really want a list of _all_ canisters, go to the dashboard that `dfx start` points you to. It contains a list of all canisters on this replica
