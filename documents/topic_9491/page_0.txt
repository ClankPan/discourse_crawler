I propose discussing and then implementing a number of measures that combined would help endow node operators with some form of plausible deniability.

What I mean here by plausible deniability is that node operators, to the furthest extent possible, will not be held responsible for the canisters that they host. This would hopefully simplify legal liability and compliance burdens of node operators, moving responsibility for removing or modifying offensive canisters to the canister author, the NNS, or enforcement outside of the protocol.

In the recent Super Mario 64 incident, apparently a DMCA takedown notice was served by Nintendo to a node operator. This is unfortunate, as the node operator was placed in an undesirable legal position, and the node operator could only practically comply by removing their node from the network. Also note that this would not have addressed Nintendo's actual concern, which was the preservation of their IP. Removal of the canister would require consensus amongst a majority of the node operators in the subnet either through an NNS vote or through direct node operator manipulation of the state of their nodes.

I propose that plausible deniability might be practically achieved in the short-term through the following mechanisms:

1. Node shuffling as discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/shuffling-node-memberships-of-subnets-an-exploratory-conversation/7478)
2. Secure enclaves/trusted execution environments as discussed [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/amd-sev-virtual-machine-support/6156)

More difficult mechanisms may be as follows:
1. Multi-party computation
2. Homomorphic encryption
3. Decentralized boundary nodes
4. Shielded IP addresses (NAT, the IC could be a giant intranet shielded by boundary nodes, IP address of canister never leaked)

There may be more mechanisms, which should be discussed in this thread.

Basically the node operators should know as little as possible about the canisters they run and vice versa. We should also know as little as possible about subnet membership.

Not only should the implementation of plausible deniability help with legal concerns, but the security of canisters on the network should be greatly increased as well. We want to avoid node operator collusion and targeted attacks on node operators hosting specific canisters.

-------------------------

I'm curious how Nintendo even knew which node provider to send the DMCA takedown to? Did they look that up on https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/?

-------------------------

northman | 2021-12-08 23:12:06 UTC | #3

Many good points which you raised in the summer if I recall.  If the data centre or node operator hosting the canister can be determined, an order to compel takedown could still be served and have to be executed by the node provider.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2021-12-08 23:19:32 UTC | #4

That's a good question. From the canister id you can get the subnet, and from the subnet and that dashboard you can get the node operators.

It's important to consider the possibility that by **obscuring** what content node providers are hosting (e.g. via node shuffling or encryption), regulators are more likely to implement blanket bans on ICP hosting within their jurisdictions.

Most regulators aren't going to accept the "globally democratic" will of the NNS; they will want to enforce local laws. Therefore, perhaps a better approach is for the NNS to curate country-specific blacklists for canisters (establishing the precise mechanism requires further discussion). Node providers can choose to "subscribe" to the blacklist for their own country, but this wouldn't censor content globally, because the NNS would just deploy a replica in another country where the content isn't illegal. Content would only be unavailable if it were illegal in all jurisdictions on Earth. A global ban wouldn't be a bad thing: it would probably only occur for material like child abuse. And of course, the NNS can always take action itself instead of waiting for regulators.

So in summary:

* Regulators will demand authority over content hosted within their jurisdictions. This is unavoidable, and ICP should have a strategy for letting node providers **opt-in** to complying with local laws, to avoid persecution. Obscuring the content hosted by node providers is not a good idea, since regulators will likely respond by enacting blanket bans on ICP.
* People seeking content that is banned in their jurisdiction can use a VPN, as always.
* The NNS has a "higher-level", jurisdiction-independent authority. This can be used to enact the will of ICP holders, as long as there are node providers somewhere on Earth who can legally comply with that will.

Why doesn't this apply to Ethereum? It has to do none of these things.

There's definitely ways. Like I mean TOR manages it.

-------------------------

Nick | 2021-12-09 00:15:11 UTC | #10

This discussion doesn't apply to Ethereum because Mario 64, which is 54 MB, would cost $18,900,000 to host on Ethereum, and so Ethereum doesn't suffer from these kinds of IP violations. The IC is encountering new challenges because it has capabilities that no other blockchain has.

[quote="Ciaran, post:11, topic:9491"]

[/quote]

I literally just gave an important reason. Governments haven't needed to take action on IP infringement on Ethereum, because Ethereum is incapable of storing IP. It can only store miniscule amounts of data (a few numbers), which is not enough to encode IP like images, video, or game files.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 00:22:03 UTC | #13

It can transfer 100s of millions in value to a terrorist organisation. That's a much bigger deal than a wee copyright infringement. Yet somehow, the forces you suggest that will come for The IC, haven't come for it. Why?

-------------------------

Nick | 2021-12-09 00:28:19 UTC | #14

Governments all over the world are discussing crypto regulations as we speak. The fact that governments haven't taken stronger action as of today has nothing to do with the design of Ethereum; governments can easily make hosting Ethereum nodes and holding ETH illegal at a moment's notice. They've simply chosen not to, because they've not had a strong enough reason. Intellectual property violation en-masse *is* a reason to ban a protocol. ICP is at risk of that, and Ethereum is not, for the reason I mentioned in my last post. The issue is purely the difference in **capability** between the protocols, not the difference in governance.

-------------------------

Nick | 2021-12-09 00:37:14 UTC | #15

ICP's current form of governance does present regulatory (and censorship) risks, but governance is not the root cause of this IP issue that has arisen.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-09 00:33:46 UTC | #16

It might, but that's a problem way down the road.

All we want to do here is prevent companies (not regulators) from sending DMCA takedowns.

If it gets to the point that governments are getting involved, I'd say we did a really great job in protecting node providers, and we can cross that bridge when we get there

-------------------------

Nick | 2021-12-09 00:41:08 UTC | #17

Sure, I suppose we could rely on governments being exceedingly slow to respond, and focus on a short-term fix. But we need to avoid ICP from developing a **reputation** for hosting illegal content. We need to protect the network's public image. Otherwise, politicians (who are narrow-sighted) will just see it as a platform for crime. An honest attempt at tackling IP violations will help ICP appear legitimate in the eyes of lawmakers.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 00:45:36 UTC | #18

I couldn't disagree more. It's everything to do with Ethereum's governance-minimised design. Since there's no locus of control, governments have pursued their policy goals above the protocol level. 

There's no reason that if The IC minimised governance a similar outcome wouldn't occur.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 00:47:45 UTC | #19

That's literally what politicians said about Bitcoin for years. Like it had no usage other than drugs for about 3 years. Chuck Schumer proposed it be banned in 2012. You're acting like the whole blockchain industry hasn't existed up until now.

-------------------------

Nick | 2021-12-09 01:06:46 UTC | #20

Perhaps a good counter-argument against my original proposal is that we don't want to give governments too many levers that they can pull to assert control over the ICP network. If we allow governments to make "official" blacklists, then they are far more likely to come up with excuses to ban things.

But ICP must offer *some* mechanism to uphold laws, including country-specific ones. If it doesn't, I can predict with 100% certainty it will be banned in many jurisdictions.

Bringing things back to this thread's topic: my main point is that obscuring what content node providers are hosting is not a sufficient solution to IP infringement in the long term. As long as this community accepts that, I'm happy.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-09 01:35:53 UTC | #21

Assume that the intention to ban the Internet Computer from every inch of the Earth is already out there -- the entire *point* of building the network is that it needs to function in this environment. 

The CEO of the DFINITY Foundation is literally out there talking about how the network is designed to survive electromagnetic pulse attacks. 

The Internet Computers ability to "uphold laws" or not won't be what gets it banned or doesn't -- what will determine how well it survives is the power of it's network to exist in the face of a hostile environment, period. 

If you think "playing by the rules" is the determining factors, then I hate to break it to you, but...

Sounds great -- this would effectively put it in the realm of TOR and similar that already exist, wouldn't it? 

Shifts the target to the entire network instead of node providers, and gives the network's original vision a real test. 

People here are also glossing over that the ability to remove canisters exists via the NNS and there are no plans to change that, correct?

If the whole *world* is against you, then you're on the wrong side of history. We don't want to enable criminal psychopaths to do as they please. Canisters need to hit a certain threshold of acceptance to be worth protecting.

The intent of the Internet Computer is not to faciliate anarchy. The IC is closer to a direct democracy (especially once we have proof of personhood).

You're just fearmongering here. I implied that "criminal psychopaths" were those that act against the will of *the whole world*. The world is not against equal rights in China, that's for sure.

> The entire root of this issue is an ethical one. How should the IC handle **illicit** content? Who says which content is **illicit** or not?

This issue that prompted this discussion has nothing to do with ethics, it's about ensuring ICP isn't outlawed globally by naive lawmakers and that its participants (in this case, node providers) aren't persecuted for "illegal activity". We have to address that issue first, and we can worry about ethics separately.

The reality is, ICP is managed by humans on Earth, and those humans are subjected to the rule of law. We have to decide which laws to evade, and which laws to follow. No blockchain project can evade all laws, unless its participants are planning to set up their own country in international waters.

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 03:17:42 UTC | #26

What makes you believe governments have accepted ETH consensus mechanism?

I’m confused by your claim regarding KYC. As an American I’ve found that I have to KYC with every exchange that I use. So the government can trace any transactions from ETH wallet (or any other crypto) back to me if they wanted to.

Edit: isn’t there an entire industry of blockchain analytics and intelligence gathering services being built up to assist in this?

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 07:11:45 UTC | #27

Not KYC. Sure in some exchanges but most require it.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 07:15:20 UTC | #28

There is always governance. The node operators are the governance system of the protocol. Then it becomes a wealth based governance system. The reason no one has done anything is because they have people in power that have much at stake.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 07:27:42 UTC | #29

Everything is tracked the only real private coin is one that uses Zero Knowledge to encrypt everything but timestamp. Even then you have to make sure your hardware and OS is not compromised. The intelligence agencies love all of this. The reason it hasn't been shut down is because why get rid of a tool that works for them.

Yet you can't offer a coherent theory as to why this prediction doesn't hold for other blockchains. Hint: The size of the file involved in criminal activity isn't relevant.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 08:36:01 UTC | #31

The fact most haven't tried to ban it suggests they accept it. China is obviously an acception. 


I'm obviously talking about KYC *on* Ethereum.


"Edit: isn’t there an entire industry of blockchain analytics and intelligence gathering services being built up to assist in this?"

Yes that's precisely the point! Crime fighting happens above the protocol level, not on it. They go after the users in question not the network maintainers.

That's a non-sequitur. For policy makers it's merely a pragmatic question of relevance vs effort. Much more likely that they simply haven't had enough motivation yet for investing significantly into measures of regulation. For the reasons @Nick gave. China already decided to crack down on Bitcoin, and nobody should believe that the same can't still happen in other jurisdictions or to other platforms if the need arises. It's completely naive to assume otherwise. Respective discussions have come up for years.

I’d argue that crime fighting only happens above the protocol level because (historically) that is where the perceived threat exists. If a user maintains control over the application then it makes sense to target them. The same goes for controversial data being served from a centralized server or front-end being hosted on a cloud provider.

Now imagine someone decides to pay the stupid amount of 💰 required to upload an immutable copy of child porn to Ethereum (is that possible, I honestly don’t know). But I think that would be an entirely different scenario that would bring all sorts of heat down on the network.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 10:57:47 UTC | #34

I don't think you know what the meaning *non sequitur* is. Most governments have not only not tried to ban bitcoin and ether, most have embraced it. They've set up digital assets task forces, approved futures contracts and ETFs. You're off your head if you think they're hostile. 

It's quite the opposite. They, unlike seemingly Dfinity stakeholders, see the value in global networks nobody controls.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 11:00:13 UTC | #35

The CIA found payments attached to terror units planning to attack the US. I assure you they give way more of a shit about that than child porn. They still sought remedies above the network. Your theory doesn't hold in practice.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 11:33:00 UTC | #36

I don't understand your argument. You say most governments like decentralized networks no one can control. It makes no sense. AWS is controlled by Bezos and top investors. So they like both type of systems. Why would they care to control something they can tax, hence why they increase the IRS budget. They already control it that way. Bitcoin went from being a currency to being an asset. We now see the IMF concerned with El Salvador making it a currency. As you see the story isn't over yet.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 11:35:18 UTC | #37

Records of those payments existing on the network doesn’t do any harm to anyone. If anything it made their job easier. Again, in this case the actual threat exists outside the protocol.

Child porn, revenge porn, and many other types of content that can’t be removed does cause emotional trauma for the victims and if you can’t remove that or at least make a meaningful effort to censor it, you are going to have entire armies of people around the world come after you.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 11:36:24 UTC | #38

Yeah all that shit exists in the dark web it has no place in IC.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 11:42:35 UTC | #39

Weird that these armies haven't gone after the TOR network.

Also those payments were payments for people to do harm. Why on earth did the US go so crazy on AML after 911?? I'm not sure what planet you live on. 

Either way, if you decide to meaningfully censor things, you'll be brought under centralised control. States will have to do this because there'll be a fiduciary. That's fine. But just don't go kidding yourself that Dfinity has built something new here.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 11:39:01 UTC | #40

-------------------------

The internet is just a connection of computers. They log everything. You don't need to control the network just the people.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 11:57:25 UTC | #45

You're being very disingenuous about many of your claims in an effort to prove your point. In your example the threat is the people who plan to do harm; not the payment system that allows full traceability between parties.

I'm not kidding myself. I fully understand what we're signing up to by keeping this type of proposal. Perhaps the network will fail because of it. If it does then so be it, but I'd rather not make a deal with a devil just to keep the 'revolutionaries' happy.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:05:30 UTC | #46

How is it disengenous? In your example the guilty parties are the people uploading revenge porn not the decentralised network maintaining it. 

It's not just about being a revolutionary. It's about understanding why Bitcoin and Ethereum have not only survived but thrived when centralised iterations that came before them failed. If Dfinity isn't going to follow their path I fail to see why it bothered to try in the first place. The outcome is foregone conclusion. Governments aren't going to allow financial interests decide what's allowed on the internet or not.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:16:27 UTC | #47

There is a big difference between the 'guilty party' and the 'threat'. The threat is the thing that is doing, or has the potential, to cause harm or do some sort of damage. I agree that in my example the guilty party is the individual who uploaded the content. But the threat is the content itself. In your example the guilty party is the terrorist group. That same terrorist group could also be the threat (we could get into arguments about the guns but I'd rather not) or something like the bomb itself could be the threat. If they capture the guilty party but the bomb is missing then the threat has not been neutralized.

You're right. We should absolutely try to understand why they both survived/thrived. There are plenty of lessons to be learned there and I think thought leaders like you, @Arthur, Vitalik, and @dominicwilliams  should be brought into the fold to figure out the best way to build a platform that provides some decentralized way to censor content at the protocol level. IMO, That's a challenge worth working on. But if you're telling me that's not worth figuring out and we should just allow this awful content to exist outside of the shadows then I can't get behind that. I'm sorry but I can't.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:18:19 UTC | #48

It would still be in the shadows. Apps above The IC can be moderated. No mainstream one would allow it. This material would be banished to apps hardly anyone uses. It's no different to how things are now.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:19:58 UTC | #49

No one has explained to me how an image or video that has been uploaded directly to a canister whose controller is set to a black hole can be taken down without this proposal. I don't consider that to be "in the shadows". If that issue can be addressed (maybe it can, i honestly don't know) then I will change my position. But that is what's holding me up right now.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:21:48 UTC | #50

It couldn't be taken down no. But it'd be on an app nobody uses. It's really no different to how all the CP is on obscure apps or encrypted messenging services now. There's no reason to believe there'd be any more of it if you couldn't censor The IC or any less of it if you could. These people will find a way.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:22:57 UTC | #51

But you don't need an app to access it? You can literally browse to the canister address. There's no obscurity there.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:24:56 UTC | #52

The address is a website. I would call a website an app. Everyone would be on the IC equivalent of Facebook. The CP would be on the IC equivalent of a TOR site. I fail to see the difference.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:25:22 UTC | #53

The difference is that a TOR site can be taken down. Will another one pop-up? sure. But that's an ongoing battle.

If we allow this then the content just stays out there forever and the amount of it will just continue to grow endlessly. I don't see how that is the same.

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:26:19 UTC | #54

It's already growing endlessly. When one TOR site is taken down another pops up with the same images a week later.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 12:26:39 UTC | #55

Shit ain't going away it will exist in Tor, IC, FBI, Epstein and every other chain. We as a community will do our best to combat it. Prob losing battle

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:27:59 UTC | #56

Yes it's not going anywhere. So don't destroy the value proposition of The IC trying to fight an unwinnable battle. Try to mitigate abuses at layers above in the knowledge an uncensorable IC brings a lot more good than bad to humanity.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:29:47 UTC | #57

Ok. I'm not trying to be unreasonable. I can see where you're going with this. But is there nothing we can do in a decentralized world to try and fight that? The IC has so much capability; is it not worth taking the time to figure out if there's something we can do at the protocol level to help fight that problem?

Edit: I guess I'm just surprised we are so willing to dismiss the problem as unsolvable

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 12:30:59 UTC | #58

Prob AI that checks images but dont know if we want to go that route. In making changes to canister

-------------------------

Ciaran | 2021-12-09 12:31:59 UTC | #59

People have thought long and hard about these things for years. In a world with multiple competing centres of power if you introduce governance it will be captured. There's simply no way around that. It really is unsolvable. Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. So push politics to layers above. 

Lots of good things are above politics and democracy. Look at the UN Charter of Human Rights. It's the most undemocratic document ever. On top of that bedrock however you can use democracy to build social and crime fighting systems. Build those things on top of The IC, not into it.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2021-12-09 12:34:43 UTC | #60

You've definitely given me more to think about. I'll have to do some research into any efforts that have been made in the past to combat this problem. **If** it really is unsolvable then I would agree with you that the protocol should just stay out of it.

-------------------------

cyberowl | 2021-12-09 12:57:38 UTC | #61

I think I get where you are coming from, most probably I would have had similar reasoning when I was young.
While agreeing with you on some I strongly disagree on others.
If what you suggest becomes reality, the IC will become a fringe (TOR-like) network with the reputation that comes with it. Good bye mass adoption.

There are different times to take different steps. 'Patience is a virtue' 'Rome wasn't built in a day`` et al. come to mind.

Right now this project needs to grow to a point where it's 'too big to fail' (like ethereum) but this will be much harder today than it was for eth (much more attention), so the comparison lacks, like most I'm reading, nuance.

Thanks for bringing this up, afaik filecoin/protocol labs wasn't shunning time and resources on exactly this issues. It's not like one has to reinvent the wheel here. Surely Dfinity legal team were looking into their research, considering filecoin is really big in China, where censorship is, how to put it, something else.

Great to see this very relevant discussion taking place here!

An important thing to note is that the Nintendo takedown notice was for the operator of a **boundary node** that was just routing traffic to the IC, not of a replica in the relevant subnet that is hosting the content. 

Technically, it will be fairly hard to hide IP addresses of boundary nodes or whatever gateways people use to access the IC, because they have to connect to them somehow. The best one can do here, AFAICS, is to "play the numbers game", having many boundary nodes in many countries that people can use to access the IC. But it will reduce people's experience if their closest gateways are taken down.

The additional problem of boundary nodes being forced offline is that access to the **entire** IC gets blocked because of one infringing canister. If the NNS decides to keep a hard line pro free speech and against taking down illegal content, then governments worldwide will start hunting down boundary nodes until the IC becomes as hard to reach as, say, Pirate Bay. Not exactly the level of adoption (or reputation) that many of us are hoping for.

-------------------------

Manu | 2021-12-09 14:54:25 UTC | #67

I think an alternative approach is to give node operators / boundary node operators a simple way to comply with legal concerns in the region they are located. For example, you could imagine that one node provider / boundary node provider can supply a "blocklist" of canister ids for which they do not want to answer any queries. Now when I host a node in Switzerland and I get some legal notice that I'm breaking Swiss law due to some specific canisters, I could just add those canister ids to my personal blocklist. That might be enough to prevent my node being taken down by law enforcement, but nodes in different regions where the content may be legal can still serve queries to that canister.

In the mario example, it would've meant that this one boundary node could've stopped serving queries to the relevant canister and hopefully avoid legal trouble / full takedown, but all other boundary nodes would still be serving it.

No. And I don't doubt these technical problems (that are above my paygrade) are tough. 

It is however, also true, that if you take the other approach and start governing what is or isn't allowed, you'll only be able to compete with AWS by following the same rules as AWS. That means all the consensus innovations are worth nought.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-09 23:37:15 UTC | #69

Okay, then let's start talking tactics --

Pick the current aspect of the ICP that you want to sacrifice:

- The Internet Identity System insofar as it provides anonymity 

- The claims Dominic has made about smart contracts such as UniSwap (which reside in gray areas around laws that are highly subject to change) being unstoppable and "not having a choice but to build on the IC."

- The ability of the NNS to be the deciding factor in whether or not a Canister stays on the network. 

Just start choosing, because there's a Pigeonhole Principle here which says if you don't want the "deal with the devil" as you put it, then one of the above (at minimum) has got to go.

So, let's just start choosing, play it out, and forget about the philosophical arguments or moral rationalizations either way.  

For the record, this idea about some content only being in the shadows unless it'd be on the Internet Computer -- 

Twitter has, in fact, repeatedly refused to take down child sexual abuse material to such a degree that they now have a lawsuit filed against them. 

Facebook, as I linked to in another post, is reported to facilitate over 50% of all child trafficking activity on the internet. 

YouTube, as you can readily find, has refused to take down several channels which have been repeatedly reported as hubs for pedophiles. 

-- The ICP has the possibility to be a unique facilitator for the good guys with defense mechanisms (through the NNS) against other content. 

Does the autonomous driving mode on a Tesla need to never crash, or does it only need to be safer than a human driver behind the wheel (who, in aggregate, crashes all of the time)?

-------------------------

free | 2021-12-10 10:18:24 UTC | #70

What I see when looking at every single entry in your list of examples above are platforms that have HUGE utility beyond the specific issues that you point to. And are seriously entrenched. E.g. can you imagine the outcry from the public and shareholders if Facebook were taken offline tomorrow until it could satisfactorily deal with all child trafficking activity taking place on the platform? The IC for now has neither of those advantages, only the potential.

Taking a more pragmatic view of things, if at this point in its evolution the IC becomes (fairly or not) widely labeled as "Silk Road on steroids" I'll let you draw the conclusions about what needs to go.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 10:30:36 UTC | #71

I personally like the blacklist approach Manu mentions. 
Still I think there should be a way to take the pressure off the node providers so they can't get spammed with takedown requests.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 10:34:20 UTC | #72

Would be nice to hear from Dfinitys legal team, surely they where thinking about this issues, how to protect the system from becoming spammed by lawyers.

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 11:01:46 UTC | #73

For me the main question in this case is still if the boundary node has any liability at all? If they are rerouting content instead of actually hosting it, does it make them liable at all?

-------------------------

roy23 | 2021-12-10 12:49:03 UTC | #74

What's about the ICA in this matter?  Aren't they onboarding nodes in the first place (at least rn) ? Might an approach like IPFS (pointed out above) be a way forward? similar to https://ipfs.io/legal/
Could be a way to funnel/review takedown requests before putting them up for review, giving the canister owner time to react, and if not ultimately vote in the NNS. 

Imo if there are only a few (boundary) nodes right now it's important to shield them from this kind of issues.

Sure the ICA could cough up some resources if not already available?

Surely getting flamed for centralistic approach here, but it's not like I want the ICA to decide on what's legal or not, just filter the trash out before having everybody vote every time some lawyer has too much spare time. 
Just trying to find a pragmatic approach here. Further down the road maybe the NNS (as registered DAO) will have a legal team through community funding dealing with issues like this, could be simply a node dao aswell, whatever rn that's the best I could come up with. Any thoughts on this approach?

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-10 22:56:54 UTC | #75

Yep, you've just made a very, very strong argument in support of what I've been saying. 

I have no idea which conclusions to draw on what will "need to go" or what didn't, because everybody at the Foundation that I have heard speak or read writings from has deliberately avoided discussing this topic until now. 

There seems to be this viewpoint that "reasonable" people just have some kind of implicit understanding of what constitutes acceptable censorship and what doesn't, in lieu of anybody actually being willing to play out the specific dynamics of various policies through discussion.

Those questions about what happens when Uniswap has a huge round of their tokens declared to be illegal securities in various countries isn't a rhetorical one -- what's your answer? What's anybody at the Foundation's answer, in reality? 

Anyways, until proven otherwise, I'll have to stick by my initial thesis that the entire project is effectively some kind of trojan horse compared to how it's been presented -- if "how it's been presented" isn't clear, just see Dominic's various statements on what the network is supposed to survive. 

-- For the record, I can't in good conscience say "this should happen" or "that should happen" with very much authority because many other people in the ecosystem have a much larger liability and livelihood exposure than me to various policy adjustments, but I can certainly use many, many, precedents raise high-probability scenarios about what I think *will* happen if things start going down various paths.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-10 22:53:41 UTC | #76

@free Okay, so here's a litmus test for you or anybody else reading this -- 

Scenario:

A fitness professional in the United States uses the Internet Computer to host a Canister that contains anecdotal evidence of medical success from patients who have used a treatment not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to cure a specific disease. 

This fitness professional then starts using the Canister to explicit promote said treatment for people with this disease, in direct violation of current government policy which explicitly dictates the language that is "acceptable" for people to use when making claims about the potential of dietary supplements, for example. 

Now what?

Does your answer change based on whether or not you personally believe that the person operating the Canister is telling the truth about the results? 

Does your answer change if you personally believe that you have no idea whether or not the person is telling the truth?

Would you have banned Ignaz Semmelweis, who was the physician-scientist that was ridiculed and laughed at by his profession and the "authorities" when he suggested that doctors who thoroughly scrubbed their hands could prevent diseases from spreading?

How about Aaron Swartz, the co-founder of Reddit who ended up killing himself after he was prosecuted for providing free access to public scientific journals by hacking into MIT's computer system?

Julian Assange? Those were classified documents he had, after all!

Edward Snowden?

The list goes on....

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-10 23:50:40 UTC | #77

This sounds like an incredibly promising path to pursue deeper.

Such a cool idea, it's essentially a system of voting through declaring the risk profile that you're willing to take on in regards to hosting specific content. 

Here's a question -- can it be done in such a way that the visibility is only one way? In other words, node operators can see Canister IDs, but nobody is able to which node operators are hosting which Canisters?

[/quote]

Take it down. Fitness instructor claiming that whatever he cooked up in a fevered dream with the goal of striking it rich overnight is literally the same as some medicine that passed multiple controlled medical studies is stupidly dangerous stuff. Doing things the right way is often incredibly painful and frustrating, but that doesn't give anyone the right to skip the whole process and yet claim they didn't. If you believe otherwise, I have a bridge to sell you.

But going back to the basics, rather than picking examples designed to tug at heartstrings, let's face the reality. In the same way the IC is not (implementation-wise) quite at the point where it can scale infinitely (wait, what?) it's also not at the point where it can afford to willfully ignore copyright issues (no one on this side of  the argument suggested for a moment to censor Ignaz Semmelweis) and still survive. You may think "so what, if DFINITY goes belly up, someone will pick up the code and go from there", but I seriously doubt that: the IC as is is an incredibly complex beast with 100+ engineers working on it for years now. I haven't seen Bitcoin's source code but I'm pretty sure I could wrap my head around it within a day.

Proposing unworkable solutions (I don't think and no one that I talked to believes for a moment that you can credibly make it impossible to find out where a canister is hosted) is not going to solve anything.

As with everything else, I believe the way forward is to start small (i.e. not demand everything matches everyone's expectations on day one) and go from there. If within a couple of years the IC will have the capability to do what you're asking and the NNS is unwilling to get behind it, then fork it. It's as simple as that. There will be software engineers at that point with a deep enough understanding of the code, willing to get behind the fork. There aren't any now. (Again, not because of ideological reasons, but because it just can't be done with what's there now.)

[quote="Tbd, post:80, topic:9491"]

There is no PLAN regarding censorship. It's a community driven project.

And while DFINITY still holds the reins for now (thanks to liquid democracy and neurons defaulting to following DFINITY) the plan (small "p") is to not be in this situation for long and actually let the community drive it entirely. At that point, if the community wants moderation, we'll have moderation. If they want anarchy, we'll have anarchy. But for the time being I'm actually comforted by DFINITY still having enough control to keep the thing afloat.

-------------------------

Tbd | 2021-12-11 16:31:33 UTC | #82

Thanks, yeah exactly DFINITY still holds the reins and the community can't really take it in whatever direction at this point. Thats why I need to know whether I should invest any more of my time into this.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-11 18:18:54 UTC | #83

This wouldn't apply to the case of DMCA/copyright situations, but I actually wonder if there's a very large lawsuit from investors waiting for DFINITY in here, depending on how things play out. 

-- You have the CEO of the Foundation running around making repeated statements that now appear like they could end up being very invalid and essentially take the teeth out of the entire value proposition. 

Or from Dapp developers who chose to build on the Internet Computer because of explicit claims about lack of "platform risk", built Dapps that were at the very least legal at the time they deployed, and then end up getting censored.

These are pretty serious things, when you start talking about misleading statements. The FOUNDATION's already got a bit of a reputation for what happened during the Genesis unlock.

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-12 00:14:41 UTC | #84

Actually, I was also trapped into thinking the same way you do, but after reviewing the web, it appears that Dominic Williams's statement were targeting private censorship, and NEVER government censorship:
https://medium.com/dfinity/disentangling-dfinity-and-ethereum-dfa2151ad419
https://www.global-geneva.com/a-swiss-initiative-to-replace-the-internet-crypto-scepticism-abounds/
https://twitter.com/dominic_w/status/1442924589428871171

Still it's disappointing not to see him here while he's posting on twitter all the time, and this not always wisely.
Lets imagine 10 years from now it IC becomes what it oughts to:
Since all ICP owners are supposed to have KYCed, then it will be a highway for the governments from anywhere in the world to force ICP/neuron owners votings for removing this or that. The more a government have ICP/neuron owners among its citizen, the more they can control what is published on the worldwide internet :-) .

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 00:39:10 UTC | #85

Thanks for the links,

I predict government censorship initiatives over the next decade (and new cryptocurrency regulations) will seriously hamper the original vision of the Internet Computer, but I can understand the strong case to say "governments having to explicitly pass new laws in order to make content on the IC censorable is a very high bar". 

Regardless, what I'd really like to hear from Foundation members is how the fact that countries around the world have very different is going to work out in practice w/ this...

Thus, I can see the most resilient scenario as enacting the ideas around a free market for node providers. 

If not, then a lot of DeFi initiatives and other things in crypto land that are currently not outlawed are basically dead in the water...

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 00:44:01 UTC | #86

From a public relations perspective, I think the lower bound on the case that DFINITY has to effectively make here is that the censorship on the Internet Computer will be less than the vulnerability of other blockchains to a similar fate -- as Dom likes to point out about Ethereum. 

I just see a vision where...without the ability for node operators to decide which content they are willing to serve through some kind of market system, the whole thing is going to get very dystopian very fast. 

A lot of the innovations (especially the IID) can snap back into the opposite of their stated purpose very quickly.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 00:46:32 UTC | #87

I say give the hardest core libertarians a way to exercise their beliefs at the same time as giving people who rely on government to determine what is acceptable behavior and what isn't.

Some people want to get as censorship happy as governments are going to...fine, as long as some people who oppose that have the right to take on that risk in IC-Land as well.

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-12 00:51:44 UTC | #88

The thing is, who will take the risk to host the illegal content if the governments wants to censor it ? In France for instance, they switched off bittorent by fining you when you upload copyrighted content.

-------------------------

guillaumestols | 2021-12-12 00:56:22 UTC | #89

If you host for everybody, then you can be spotted, this is for sure. The only way I can see would be to exchange hosting, you host what is forbidden abroad, and foreigners host what is forbidden in your juridiction.

-------------------------

MisterSignal | 2021-12-12 01:48:20 UTC | #90

-- People who are in a situation where:

They live in a country where content that is illegal in another jurisdiction is not illegal in their home country

AND

They believe strongly that the controversial content should not be censored

Point is that by giving people the option to do so, you let every node operator decide how much risk they believe is worth it for various content pieces.

-------------------------

MotoshiNakasato | 2021-12-12 02:28:58 UTC | #91

The network has been consistently marketed by Dom as resistant to the kind of regulation that Uniswap faced when it had to delist coins though, that narrative seems to be falling apart quite quickly.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2021-12-12 05:53:51 UTC | #92

People understand what they are dealing with. And people is smart enough to know that 100% censorship resistance is impossible for blockchain to gain real mass-adoption. And I believe, it is not IC is aiming to be. For people that prefer anarchy, they can use other protocol, such as dark web, tor network, etc. These kind of anarchy protocols, IMO are not going to get mass real adoption for sure, they only serves niche market.
At current state, IC makes censorship is not as easy as happen on web 2.0. As the IC grows and evolves in the future, it will even harder to censor. (but still, censorship is possible if community decide to vote for it)

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2021-12-12 07:00:24 UTC | #93

Actually, one of the use cases of IC Dom brought up in his seminal 20-year plan Medium [article](https://medium.com/dfinity/announcing-internet-computer-mainnet-and-a-20-year-roadmap-790e56cbe04a) is a decentralized form of Uber:

> If rapid adoption resulted, powerful competitors might be irked and try to slow things down with lawsuits, but here Open Rides would have an advantage: open internet services run autonomously as part of the fabric of the internet, here in the mode of an advanced P2P protocol that connects drivers with riders, and code cannot easily be stopped. As autonomous code on the internet, Open Rides might be made instantly available in all territories around the world, without expensive negotiations with regional governments who are doing the bidding of local taxi monopolies wishing to protect their turf

Not sure if how that would work here... when do we draw a line between submitting a canister takedown proposal and not?

----

Side question, since I saw it brought up in the other thread:

Can't governments treat the NNS (and other DAOs) as legal entities, just like they treat corporations as legal entities?

Then, they could sue them and extract penalties, I guess? How would that work? Who would represent the NNS in court? Is there even a concept of "management" for DAOs? If so, isn't a DAO basically just a more digitalized corporation at that point?

Multi-national corporations, multi-jurisdictional DAOs... is there a legal difference?

-------------------------

"You can send out a DMCA notice, not just for infringing material, but also for any indices, references, or pointers that lead to infringing material."

Does this apply to boundary nodes at all?

I agree this will set an important precedent, and ideally the nodes should be not in a position to deal with any legal claims. Just how to get there? 
Through technical improvements? Will this actually solve the problem as to nodes getting served?
Through courts? Does this even make sense?
Could doing nothing result in nodes simply getting blacklisted/blocked by service providers?
Could a node's decision to have a canister blocked/removed be seen as admitting responsibility?

I feel like we reached some crossroads here, specially where to draw the line of who is accountable in the end. Does the NNS vote on every canister that might be seen infringing on others rights? Does that mean the NNS is responsible for all content on the IC ?

-------------------------

Maxfinity | 2021-12-14 01:46:18 UTC | #96

I'd like to add to the list of proposals - Dfinity could look at separating the data layer from the compute layer, and distributing the data across many laptop-grade nodes. Using something like erasure encoding could help ensure that data is split across many nodes and not be lost. It will increase latency and also increase the bandwidth requirements but may have lower bandwidth requirements than shuffling.

Erasure encoding data and making having stateless clients was one of the directions considered for ETH 2.0. @lastmjs

lastmjs | 2021-12-14 05:22:51 UTC | #97

In addition to plausible deniability for replica node operators, another key piece of the solution to the censorship problem may be making boundary node operators the actual censors. Please explode this idea with us: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-nodes-as-censors/9640
