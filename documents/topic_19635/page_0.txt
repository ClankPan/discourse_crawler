I have just finished creating my little todo app with a motoko backend and react frontend, locally everything is working fine, I can deploy my canisters and use them fine but after deploying the project on the icp networkt with the command "dfx deploy --network ic", the deployement is successfull, the backend canister url is working but on my front-end canister url thats where I am getting 404 error when I try to access it. What could be the problem? 
[This is my github repo](https://github.com/iamenochchirima/IC-ToDo) for the little project. Thank you in advance to those that will help.

This is most likely because of this change: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/follow-up-on-item-new-canisters-will-only-be-accessible-through-the-icp0-io-domain-existing-canisters-will-be-accessible-both-through-ic0-app-and-icp0-io/18889

`dfx` before version 0.14.0 (which released yesterday) only prints the old URL under which your newly created canister is not accessible anymore. Simply change `ic0.app` to `icp0.io` and you should be good to go
