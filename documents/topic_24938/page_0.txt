Hi IC community! 

This Isaque from the Nuvlio team delivering some news! So, buckle up. 

## **What is Nuvlio?**

Nuvlio provides global, historic and real-time agriculture commodities with data, analytics and scoring since January 2000 up to today for any place on Earth. Nuvlio still an web2 company providing services to financial players that deal with agricultural commodities, however, the great migration have been in the making since 2021, and now the first step have been completed.

Nuvlio start to stabilish the oracle capacities in the Internet Computer ecossystem to overtime provide full start to end IC based oracle services. With that, any DEFI, fintech or financal players that operates credit, insurance, reinsurance, trade finance or environmental services can leverage Nuvlio Commodities Risk Intelligence Oracles to automatize from acquisition up to the end of the financial contracts, with verifiable information and access through the Internet Computer.

This will enable multiple developer teams to build #RWA real life financial services to massive industries like the agriculture commodities, and Nuvlio will provide everything your project will need to easy launch a full solution with minimal development.

## **How this works?**

The Nuvlio Commodities Risk Intelligence Oracles collect data from over 500 sources that cover since the year 2000, standarize it, clean it, aggregate it, generate multiple metrics and over 70 scores (from environmental scores, weather scores, growth scores and financial scores) combining statistical modelling, machine learning and data analysis, and producing a set of reports about the contract location under analysis. 

## **How is Nuvlio IC Oracles built**

The actual configuration of Nuvlio Oracles in the IC is based on the HTTP out calls that consume the Nuvlio API services that are hosted in the cloud. The Nuvlio engine in the cloud is capable to do the heavy computational tasks of hundreds of gigabytes per each location analysis and provide IC compatible API for the IC ecosystem to build on top.
