How to obtain all the canisters ID on the dfinity chain and the latest deployed canisters ID, just like IC. Rocks. Do you have an API

-------------------------

There is no API. I think rocks.ic is using knowledge about how the subnets allocate IDs and just checks if the next one appears.

Can you find the rules for subnet ID allocation?  or Subnet ID allocation is performed in orderï¼Ÿ
