Please join the DFINITY Foundation on June 30, 2020 for a special event — Tungsten. 
 
“The future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed” 
 
For the over 250,000 community members closely following the development of the Internet Computer, William Gibson's words capture the spirit of a generational shift in technology already underway. Similar to transitions from mainframes (1960s) to PC and client server (1980s) to the internet (1990s) to cloud, mobile and social (2000s), the Internet Computer (2020s) represents the next major shift in computing — to a decentralized and non-proprietary network to run the next generation of mega-applications. In turn, this generational shift in computing aims to take on Big Tech and return the internet back to its free and open roots. 
 
Attendees will join Dominic Williams (Founder and Chief Scientist at DFINITY), prominent academics and venture capitalists, distinguished engineers, and third-party developers already building on the Internet Computer for a series of discussions, talks and demos. 
 
Join to start building.

Registration will be limited.
