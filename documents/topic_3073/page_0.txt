Hello Confluent community! I hope to see some familiar faces here and hope to meet some new faces as well.

I’m Marc W. from Minnesota. I built my first website back in 1995 and have dabbled in web development on and off since then. I have a pretty broad set of IT skills and use to run an IT consulting firm. I’ve been looking for a while for the next big thing in the IT world and I think I’ve found it!

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to say hello here in the forum or in a direct message.
