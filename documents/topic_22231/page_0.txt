Hello everyone! It's time for another issue of team spotlight. 

For this edition, we interviewed the Node team to learn more about the core technology of the Internet Computer. The node team is an extremely vital component of the Internet Computer, since they are responsible for the very foundation of the IC: nodes. I hope you're as excited as we are to learn more!
