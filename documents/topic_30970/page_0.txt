Hi 

I am trying to get started with the motoko bootcamp. I had thought I had setup my development environment correctly but it appears that it's having an issue with mops.

I am running on windows with WSL 2. dfx start works and appears to list the canisters correctly but dfx deploy is failing to build

Any ideas how to fix this?

mops wasn't installed, assumed dfx install would do it
