Hello Dears!

When I try to install wasm module, a simple code works, but some complex codes shows an error: `wrong magic number: [32, 0, 0, 0]`

May I wrongly converting wasm to `Vec<u8>`?
Or how can I deal with that?

This likely means that some code was expecting Candid-encoded data, but received something else (raw binary data).

In your case, is this error coming from your canister? `dfx`? the JS library?

In my case it comes from dfx that I'm trying to install canister dynamically
Now I think may be I'm building wasm code wrongly
The question is how to create Candid-encoded wasm?

I found this error message related to initial arguments when installing canister code

Ah, it could also complain about the wrong magic number of a wasm module, of course. Sorry for jumping to conclusions.

What is the command line you use to install canister code?

I'm using rust to install canister programmatically
