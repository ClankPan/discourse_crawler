Hi there. Currently have a canister function that takes a Float (float64) value. Trying to pass the value as such: addFloat '(1.2345)' but doesn't seem valid. Any help appreciated!

Hi Oli
That should work fine from the terminal, eg `dfx canister call hello addFloat ‘(1.2345)’` , or were you trying something different?
