What is the best way to query the neuron ids held by a seed account? I am using an air-gapped computer and stuck after this step: https://github.com/dfinity/docs/blob/master/modules/token-holders/pages/seed-donations.adoc#on-your-networked-computer. It doesn't look like there is any way to dissolve a neuron without knowing its id in advance.

I do have the resulting hex string from the `dfx canister --network=https://ic0.app --no-wallet send message.json` command, but I am not able to decode it with `didc`. Any help would be much appreciated!
