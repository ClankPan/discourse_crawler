Recently I saw a great Candid presentation by  @chenyan Jan Chen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo5SxW4G7P8

In that presentation he demoes IC-REPL which is here:
https://github.com/dfinity/ic-repl

I would like to compile it and run it on my Apple Silicon Map, can someone give me a clue how to do this? Is it just a question of doing a simple Rust compilation from the source, or is it more involved, help most appreciated!

Should be a simple `cargo build`, but you can probably also download a prebuilt one from the [releases](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-repl/releases)

Thanks Severin! 

I missed the Releases part of the repository, very cool to have it ready to go. This tool is quite useful too, thanks to @chenyan for leading its development.
