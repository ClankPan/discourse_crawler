Am I doing something wrong, or does the `@dfinity/agent` not work in the Next.js SSG context?

In a pre-rendered Next.js project set for static export (`output: "export"`), I am defining the request `generateStaticParams`, which is used to generate the dynamic routes at build time. Within that function, I use the `HttpClient` to fetch some data, as in this dummy example:

```javascript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
    const agent = await HttpAgent.create({
        identity: new AnonymousIdentity(),
        host: "https://icp-api.io",
        verifyQuerySignatures: true,
    });

    const actor = Actor.createActor(idlFactory, {
        agent,
        canisterId: "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
    });

    const {icrc1_balance_of} = actor;

    // ⚠️ ERRORS
    // - Invalid signature from replica
    // - Certificate is signed more than 5 minutes in the past ...
    console.log(await icrc1_balance_of({
        owner: Principal.fromText("2vxsx-fae"),
        subaccount: []
    }))

    return [{product_id: "2vxsx-fae"}]
}
```

As a result, I end up facing the following errors (one or the other):

> Error: Invalid certificate: Invalid signature from replica ncr4b-rasb7-tueb3-n4uos-5nxou-3wbxv-xmyt3-wfdsd-vu4b6-5x3cp-aqe signed query.

or
> Error: Invalid certificate: Certificate is signed more than 5 minutes in the past. Certificate time: 2024-08-11T15:55:32.249Z Current time: 2024-08-11T16:03:35.551Z

So I'm wondering if I am doing something wrong or if indeed Agent-js does not work in that context?

This error was reported by a Juno developer, and I am able to reproduce it with a sample repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/peterpeterparker/next-agentjs
cd next-agentjs
npm ci
npm run dev
```

@peterparker Did you find any workarounds?

Kind of, see this [PR](https://github.com/krlsdgzmn/agira-dapp/pull/2).

I'd use `createSync` for SSG contexts as the simple fix, but the point is probably more to do with `fetch` or `syncTime` not working as intended. 

I have another reported issue with the `syncTime` flow, so I'm going to dive into this and get back to you
