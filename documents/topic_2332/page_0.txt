I have three motoko source file: callee.mo, caller.mo and maker.mo to test composability.
The caller will call the functions in the callee, and the maker will create and install caller in new canister.

### source code
[details="source code"]

callee:
```motoko
actor class Callee() {
    private var a : Nat = 1;

    public func add1() : async Nat {
        a += 1;
        a
    };

    public query func get() : async Nat {
        a
    };
};
```
caller:
```motoko
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
import Callee "./callee";

actor class Caller(_callee: Principal) {
    public type CalleeActor = actor {
        add1: () -> async Nat;
        get: query () -> async Nat;
    };

    private var calleeHandler : CalleeActor = actor(Principal.toText(_callee));

    public func add1() : async Nat {
        await calleeHandler.add1()
    };

    public func get() : async Nat {
        await calleeHandler.get()
    };
};
```
maker:
```motoko
import Array "mo:base/Array";
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
import Caller "./caller";

actor class Maker() {
    private stable var callers : [Principal] = [];

    public func newCaller(callee: Principal) : async Principal {
        let callerActor = await Caller.Caller(callee);
        let callerId = Principal.fromActor(callerActor);
        callers := Array.append<Principal>(callers, [callerId]);

        callerId
    };

    public query func getcallers() : async [Principal] {
        callers
    };
};
```
[/details]

### compile result
the `callee.mo` and the `caller.mo` is compiled and run successfully, and the `maker.mo` is failed:

[details="log"]
```sh
$ sudo dfx build maker

`failed with exit status 'exit code: 2'`  seems to indicate that this is not a problem caused by the source code, because the source code error will produce `exit code: 1`, and the error will be located in a specific line of the source code. And the `caller.mo` has been successfully compiled and run before.


### solved
Sometime later, making some changes in `caller.mo` fixes it, in other words,  `maker.mo` is compiled and run successfully when `caller.mo` is :
[details="caller.mo"]
```motoko
import Principal "mo:base/Principal";
import Callee "./callee";

actor class Caller(_callee: Principal) {

    private var calleeHandler : actor {
        add1: () -> async Nat;
        get: query () -> async Nat;
    } = actor(Principal.toText(_callee));

    public func add1() : async Nat {
        await calleeHandler.add1()
    };

    public func get() : async Nat {
        await calleeHandler.get()
    };
};
```
[/details]
The only changes is deleting type `CalleeActor`, and everythings are ok.

Thanks for the very detailed bug report. I'll investigate. I take it you have a workaround so are not blocked on this?

I'm not blocked on this, thx

This has now been fixed (might take a dfx release or two to surface). Thanks again for reporting the bug!
