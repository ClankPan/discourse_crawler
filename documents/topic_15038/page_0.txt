So. Is internet computer an operating system? That lives on unknown networked hardware? 
Im trying to wrap my head around in really simple terms.
I get or dont care how things are stored. But maybe i should?  Just like i dont care how windows works or stores info, i just want to save my pictures in a pictures folder. Lol

Can you explain for someone who is dumb?
Ty
God bless you

Please read this [wiki](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Internet_Computer_wiki) for a better understanding.

I think an operating system for a decentralized network of computers is a pretty good analogy, but the IC takes it a step further by hosting smart contracts, which can run autonomously unlike processes in a traditional OS. This is something that Kubernetes (something often billed as an OS for a data center) cannot do.

Thank you. I really liked the description in the hackathon video. 
I tried a practice program using Angela Yu's Udemy course, and got it to work fine.
However i was concerned with the idea that a canister will need "refilled" by buying more icp token.  I couldnt get a read on how expensive it would be to keep a simple program running in a canister? Is it like paying rent? 
Also if the cost of icp token increases, will ot get more expensive to host a program?
Thanks in advance.
God bless

It's similar to web2 where you rent a server. In return, the IC is MUCH cheaper to deploy things to - What costs you a few cents on the IC can easily cost you thousands of dollars on ETH for example.

Computation and storage have constant cost, [see here for details](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/deploy/computation-and-storage-costs). Or [this](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/calculate-an-estimate-of-cycles-consumption-a-universal-example/12526/17) amazing post by @gabe.
