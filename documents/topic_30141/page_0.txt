Right now, I can only see the status of a canister if I am at the project's root, which basically means I can't see all my canisters at once. I know I have some rogue canister's running, but it's a pain to find them, would be nice to be able to locate/close them without having to go into each folder.

There is not a `dfx` command that shows all canisters that a principal is a controller of.

You can use the [IC Data Dashboard](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canisters) to view the controllers of each canister.
