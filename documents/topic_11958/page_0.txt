It seems that the "Reset Followees for the "All Topics Except Governance" Category" proposal can be a good solution to the reward problem @wpb 

# But this doesn't really prevent spam proposals, because in addition to that, spam proposals have the following motivations

1. You will have to pay attention to the motion proposal due to weight issues, which makes the motion proposal a broadcast of the community

2. The purpose of garbage proposals is not to be executed but to be seen by the community

## How to use $34,000 to conduct a spam proposal attack on NNS. (I will not implement this attack at the moment)

### For proposers:

1. The proposer uses USD 34,000 to buy 1,700 ICPs, the daily interest is 1ICP, and the proposer will get the right to propose every day.
2. The purpose of the proposer can be to make ICP better, to spread their own ideas, to promote products, or to defraud the community.
3. The growth of the ICP token price does not prevent this attack, and as the ICP price grows, the influence of the motion proposal will also grow.

### To voters

1. Due to the weight of the motion proposal, voters will be forced to view the content of the motion proposal and vote on it every day. At this point, most of the attacker's goals have been completed
2. Since the motion proposal has no content restrictions, voters will see various information, such as pornographic, bloody content

### For stakers

1. If he does not vote on the motion proposal, then he will give up most of the proceeds
2. If he does not want to give up his gains, then he must vote every day.
3. He can manually vote every day and encounter the problems that voters will encounter, or he can choose any one in the "known neuron list" to follow (this will be the choice of most people, and this is what I recommend The main reason for deleting the "known neuron list" of the motion proposal, especially when the "automatic reinvestment" function is completed, ordinary investors will lose the motivation to participate in governance, he only needs to buy ICP, lock ICP, and turn on automatic reinvestment. To cast, randomly select a neuron to follow in the list of known neurons. Then NNS will not be a governance system for him, but a financial management tool. PS: At present, many people do this)

### For NNS

1. Most neurons will not be able to bear to read proposals and vote on motion proposals every day, they will choose to follow the neurons in the "known neuron list".
2. The attack only needs $34,000 to make NNS very centralized

## Several possible solutions to avoid this attack

1. Review the content of the proposal in various ways.
2. Increase the funding threshold for initiating proposals.
3. Decrease the weight of motion proposals.
4. DFINITY has mentioned the mechanism of the spam prevention proposal in the roadmap. I would like to know how it is designed. I hope DFINITY will announce more information as soon as possible. @diegop

I don’t think the threat at the end was necessary. Even if you don’t care about the implications now I would be careful in the future about such things.

Otherwise, I do think you make some valid points.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-06 13:03:01 UTC | #3

I think it can get more people's attention

mparikh | 2022-04-06 13:45:42 UTC | #4

You are quite correct in that this attack can be implemented and would be quite effective (currently). 

Unfortunately it doesn't require YOU to carry on this attack. It can be done by anyone else at time of their choosing.

Really the only thing that will solve it is everyone participating in governance motion proposals (either manually or through following). 

On spam, there's a cost (1icp) associated with generating a proposal. Yeah, it could be spam. But who's to judge whether it's spam or not?

Kyle_Langham | 2022-04-06 14:02:33 UTC | #5

I'm glad to see you posting the forum with the intention of driving dialogue on a potential security threat for the NNS (although, the last sentence was over-the-top imo).

To add to the dialogue, here are some additional solutions that could be considered:

* Drastically increase the number of named neurons with people and groups that are clear with their voting strategy and intended goals.  In this solution, most neuron holders will follow a named neuron and the "spam" will only be seen by the voters of the named neurons (this is my preferred solution)
* Create a multi-step process for creating proposals.
* Create a penalty for proposals that fail to reach a threshold of votes or an option for voters to identify a proposal as spam.

ysyms | 2022-04-06 14:12:09 UTC | #6

ok i modified it _____

-------------------------

weedpatch2 | 2022-04-06 14:19:28 UTC | #7

I like the multi-step process idea. If there were a web UI that made submitting proposals simple, but submitted them to a public review board (on the same site), before the actual NNS, and the board required a certain number of upvotes to be submitted to the NNS; we could defeat the spam proposals from those that can't/don't submit over dfx (like those that think Entrepot is necessary). 

Additional decentralization (your first option) is the best solution here, asked it will happen over time.

You are really smart for a high school kid @ysyms.  :smiley:.  I really appreciate your engagement in governance discussions and the effectiveness of the tactics you have chosen to stimulate discussion.  Well played!

I'm not sure if you have seen it yet, but @justmythoughts started a [forum topic discussion](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/community-discussion-revise-governance-voting-rewards-to-fix-proposal-spamming-rewards-exploit/11915) two days ago that I think has some really good ideas as well.  The two ideas that have surfaced that I think have high potential for developing into a good solution to this type of attack include:

1. Allocate 75% of total voting rewards each day to Governance participation on a 21 day rolling average (since we don't have governance proposals daily).  This way it doesn't matter how many proposals are submitted or if there is a proposal submitted every day.  I'd be curious if @johan or others at Dfinity have already considered this idea.
2. When a proposal is submitted to the NNS, a new forum Governance topic is created automatically on the forum with a minimum deliberation time period requirement (potentially set by the proposal lead).  Then after the deliberation time, the proposal lead is required to submit a follow up proposal (potentially a revision) to the NNS in order for it to become active for voting.  I'm sure there are other variations that would make sense, but this gets at the need for deliberation.  It doesn't have to be the current forum, but that is what we have available at this time and makes sense for now.

I'm interested in your thoughts on how to improve decentralization if motion proposal weights are reduced.  What would drive people to follow anyone other than Dfinity?  How can Dfinity and our IC community escape accusations of centralization if more public known neurons don't step up to the task of representing the community (and not follow other public known neurons) and people are not incentivized to follow them?  You clearly have given a lot of thought to the governance system, so I'm curious what you think are solutions to that problem.

By the way, I agree with your assessment that the proposal to [reset default following for All Topics Except Governance](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reset-followees-for-the-all-topics-except-governance-category/11922?u=wpb) does not address spam attacks that are initiated for the purpose of community announcements or advertising.  That proposal only removes the incentive for spam proposals by anyone who wants higher voting rewards with the current system.

-------------------------

Mr_Burkes | 2022-04-06 16:49:50 UTC | #11

I don't see why we have to vote to receive rewards. 

Shouldn't abstaining be a valid vote? What if I don't have enough technical knowledge to cast an educated vote? I just have to blindly click approve/reject to get my rewards? It skews the incentives for progressing the network.

I think doing away with "vote to get rewards" in favor of a classic staking model (e.g. PoS rewards) makes more sense. This would prevent spam proposals from getting any attention, because everyone would just ignore them, knowing that they'll still get their rewards whether or not they vote.

-------------------------

Heihachi | 2022-04-06 17:34:52 UTC | #12

1. Every proposal must be set by a followee
2. Followees are responsible for the content of their proposals
3. Followees must participate or-and be DAO
4. DAO must be voted in order to be followees
5. DAO must vote before setting a proposal
6. The result of their votes must easily shown to everyone
7. For any illegal content of any proposal, authorities must be informed and the DAO setted the proposal is responsible for that.
8. Rewards must be distributed to the voters that their vote=results. If I vote adopt and the result is reject, I cannot be rewarded and the opposite.

paulyoung | 2022-04-06 18:04:00 UTC | #13

I’ve been concerned about this for a while and knew it was only a matter of time before someone did it.

I also wondered if someone starting to submit spam proposals would be the motivation for change or if we could get ahead of that.

> I think this is probably at least worth a conversation (if not a full analysis) of how the penalty for submitting a spam proposal is far outweighed by the ICP minted in voting rewards.
>
> I believe this could create incentives for spam proposals to be submitted as they would always result in a net positive for voters.

@ysyms I notice that the neuron from which you are submitted these proposals has 0 ICP in it. I also notice that 2 months ago, about 200 other neurons were created with 0 ICP staked. 2 questions:

1. How did you manage to create this neuron without ICP?
2. Are you sure the attack hasn't started already?

Thanks again for bringing necessary changes to the internet computer :smile:

Since I was at mentioned, I should note that I am not personally privy to designs on spam prevention, but I believe research team has some thoughts (and consider it important). However, I do not want to dangerously speculate due to my own ignorance on this topic.

For 1, I don't understand how it is implemented.
For 2, it looks like it can't avoid broadcasting motions to the community

There will be a Twitter space about NNS tomorrow, I may reveal my thoughts on this later

abstaining is a valid vote if you use a super majority voting system rather than a simple majority system

-------------------------

Mr_Burkes | 2022-04-07 13:02:04 UTC | #19

Then perhaps a supermajority system is what we need. My point for casting blind approve/reject votes still stands.

MrPink13 | 2022-04-08 07:50:50 UTC | #20

I am heavily in favor of Dominic's voting proposal Idea which he posted on twitter. 

"my guess is we'll need to have random subsets of neurons "second" governance proposals before prime time, auto-repeating with larger subsets when the result is indeterminate ". - Dominic. 

This idea is immense. Not only does it deal with the current spam proposal scenario, adding randomization to any voting system helps with decentralization as well.

The NNS as a system needs to evolve by creating strong decentralized protocols that avoid simple if-then error catching solutions. It has to be organic with layers of filtering and verification, thankfully blockchains allow this to be easily possible

Dom's threshold voting solution solves this. It randomly chooses a set of neurons from a population which then decides whether the proposal is fraudulent or not. If it is found to be spam it will then do nothing the proposal ends there. If the small group of neurons find the proposal to be valid or indeterminate, they fire which activates a larger group of neurons to do the same thing, and so and so on. Each group further validating the proposal. ( I added my own bit there, it moves to another larger group even if its valid)

However for this to fully work we still need the human element that can actually read through proposals, manually vote on them and not just follow governance leaders. Unfortunately, the only real solution at the moment is people parties, maybe once A.I advances we can shift directions then.

If am excited to see if Dom further pursues this line of thinking and what he develops out of this base idea. 

Exciting stuff here.

First, in terms of economic motivation, choosing this attack method wastes a lot of time and energy of the attacker, but it will not increase the attacker's profit, nor will it cause any asset loss, and the attacker's motivation is not very high. Enough, I suggest that you implement an attack immediately to test the robustness of the ICP network.

If not, just set the neuron to follow another one

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-09 05:44:00 UTC | #24

1. ～

 2. In the future, voters may need to vote every day, but this is not the fault of the spam proposal, with the development of ICP, voters will face various motions

 3. The real threat of junk proposals to NNS is to use proposals with very objectionable content to make neurons give up governance, which forces neurons that originally wanted to participate in governance to follow other neurons, thus making NNS more and more centralized

Do you agree with the above two points?

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-09 16:15:44 UTC | #25

I agree the IC will grow and there will be frequent governance proposals in the future.  I also agree spam proposals can cause people to give up on paying attention to governance.  Hence, proposals need to be actionable and well deliberated.

I think decentralization is addressed by having many options for Followee configuration in the NNS dApp and by giving people a reason to think about who they should follow (or a reason to vote manually).  If dfinity always votes, then people will naturally follow dfinity.  If governance proposals have equal weight to all other proposals and there are 144+ other proposals each day, then naturally there is no incentive to participate in governance proposals.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-10 01:07:50 UTC | #26

Attack-type spam proposals must be addressed.  As for meaningless proposals, it can be solved by dynamically adjusting the required funding threshold for initiating proposals

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-10 01:22:26 UTC | #27

I don't understand why the list of known neurons requires a vote to join.  Maybe we're all working on decentralization right now, but neurons in the "known neuron list" can easily gain more power.  We cannot hope that there will be people willing to share their rights after the ICP restructures the Internet.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-10 13:44:44 UTC | #28

That’s a fair point.  It is a high threshold to become a named neuron and there is risk that existing named neurons will tend to reject new names neurons.  I hope that’s not the case, but it can’t be guaranteed.  I’m a big advocate for more names neurons and I can’t think of anyone in the ICPMN, cycledao, or ICDevs who is against adding more names neurons.  Everyone I have ever talked to seems to agree.  However, I suppose named neurons do need to have a presence in the community it order to have the highest probability of success at becoming a named neuron.

It’s also important to note that named neurons do not own or control their followers.  They don’t get to choose their followers and they can’t hold on to them.  Only the follower gets to choose their Followees.  Hence, as more names neurons come online, I would expect there to be some movement of followers as people periodically re-validate their Followees.

-------------------------

wpb | 2022-04-10 02:50:31 UTC | #29

What do you think is a reasonable funding threshold right now?  I think 10 ICP sounds about right.  I’m curious what you think is appropriate.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-10 03:05:19 UTC | #30

I don't know what the exact value is, I think it needs to be dynamically adjusted based on the efficiency of NNS processing proposals and the number of recent proposals

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-10 03:07:44 UTC | #31

Also, proposal initiation fees should be doubled on weekends and holidays

kvic | 2022-04-16 20:35:27 UTC | #32

Why not implement democracy and give all stakeholders just 1 vote. 

Proposers would then have no power to force their agendors, promote products or defraud the community without the support of many. 

This would streamline proposers and voters should be able to ignore Proposers who they feel are bad Stakeholders.

I look for duplications to find problems and this same point has been brought up many times so this must be a real concern without a solution. 

So get rid of the problem and consider my idea.

Also the Proposal should have a Yes, No and Reject in that way a proposer runs the risk of a community decision to give a stakeholder the option to vote only.

-------------------------

Zilla | 2022-04-25 20:15:54 UTC | #33

If everyone had equal votes then what would be the point of having a Neuron above the minimum ICP required when you could just bot 500,000 different accounts with 1 ICP each and still have the same amount of voting power as someone with a single 500k ICP neuron right now? KYC and people parties would create an unnecessary step to onboard more voters, the current design was chosen deliberately by Dfinity and with good reason.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-04-25 20:36:38 UTC | #34

I asked the question as I didn't want to see big tech like dominance take control like we have today. Everyone so far has spoken like a true hacker, knowing how to attack but no one pointed me to the documentation that ICP has already consider this already and disproved the likely hood of a 51% attack, so I withdraw my concerns as I feel I finely have the answer to my question.

51% Attacks on Governance
A key security concern is the prevention of an attacker gaining 51 percent of the voting power, or even just enough that they can tip the balance in favor of those who vote unwisely, which will damage the success of the network. (The term “attacker” here applies equally to an actor who wishes to harm the network, an actor whose influence will be malign by accident, and one that might simply excessively centralize power.) Luckily, all things being equal, the colossal value of ICP locked inside the NNS makes it exorbitantly expensive to acquire such a stake. Furthermore, the financial investment required would be difficult to recoup, since ICP that have been purchased and locked would dramatically lose value if the network were harmed. Even if resources were less of a concern — for example, where an attacker was a malign state actor — unlocked ICP could not be purchased quickly on financial exchanges, since the vast majority of the overall ICP supply is locked in neurons to earn rewards. This would force such an attacker to build up their position slowly over time, with the buy pressure created by significant

saikatdas0790 | 2022-04-28 05:02:22 UTC | #35

I've been following the conversation around voting decentralization for some time and was wondering what your thoughts around the following are:

Instead of dividing up the non-voters' rewards between voters, what if we had multipliers for flat rewards for each category of proposals/voters:
- 0.1X for exchange rate proposals
- 1X for non-governance proposals
- 10X for governance proposals

The above is similar to what we currently have

Now, for neurons voting individually, we have a multiplier of let's say 2X and for neurons following others, we have a multiplier of 1X. That way we're incentivizing **decentralization** by incentivizing individuals to vote by themselves and not rely on a centralizing third-party to vote on your behalf. But you can still choose to do so, if you don't have time to vote and get the current rate of rewards.

its no difference than giving up voting power for blackrock, vanguard, states street type of like within the NNS if we really going to implement that.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-04-28 19:46:32 UTC | #37

The return on betting yes or no is the same. Once manual voting is not the same as the reward for following voting we can't stop people from randomly voting on proposals using other tools
