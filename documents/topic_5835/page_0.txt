Hi everyone

I'm an industrial engineer from South Africa with side interests in economics and Web3. I've been an Internet Computer enthusiast since 2017, and was lucky enough to be part of the airdrop.

I've been working on an IC dapp concept for crowdfunding the release of intellectual property. It implements a novel funding protocol to mitigate the free-rider problem and enable efficient price discovery. I'm looking to collaborate with a developer to apply for a Dfinity Foundation grant. If you have an interest in this field or would like to know more, give me a shout.

Cheers,
Malcolm

My name is Cleve Bissoon from Cape Town. I have been studying and getting into the code since one of my friends is a senior developer so we have been learning alot about Web3 and striving to become a better developer is my aspiration. 

Let me know if i can help to collaborate with you on Dfinity if there is any roles for me, and yeah we should have a Google Meets some time!
