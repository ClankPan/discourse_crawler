### TLDR;

* Building off native Bitcoin integration, ckBTC has the potential to greatly expand Bitcoin’s functionality by allowing fast and cheap BTC transactions on the Internet Computer.
* The reality: Centralized entities classify bitcoin transactions and will reject, so called, “tainted” bitcoin.
* Without modification of the ckBTC system there is a risk of ckBTC users receiving bitcoin classified as “tainted”. A risk which we must address.
* The goal: maintain the fungibility of bitcoin and the user’s ability to redeem ckBTC to BTC 1:1 and sell on CEXs without issues.
* Possible solution: Incorporate KYT (Know Your Transaction) services into ckBTC in a decentralized manner.

### Intro

With the launch of ckBTC, the Internet Computer provides a fast, inexpensive and decentralized way of transacting bitcoin in canister smart contracts. However, enabling bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to transact directly on the Internet Computer comes with risks as some crypto transactions are considered illicit by authorities. These risks must be taken seriously.

The most obvious example of problematic transactions are those with ‘tainted’ bitcoin, which is bitcoin associated with illicit activity. Multiple chains and bitcoin users have been affected by tainted bitcoin. While the value of transactions involving illicit addresses represent a relatively small portion of the total ([0.15% in 2021](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/)), it may increase as the industry moves towards more interoperability, and as authorities increase monitoring and regulating activities. The crypto community may see bitcoin as a fully fungible token, however, this is unfortunately not the case in practice – not all UTXOs are created equal.

ckBTC is meant to provide a fully decentralized way of transacting bitcoin quickly and cheaply using the Internet Computer. However, ckBTC is not invincible from ‘tainted’ UTXOs. Although ‘tainted’ bitcoin is very rare, such bitcoin in transit on the Internet Computer would have unfavorable consequences for the ICP community. For instance, ‘untainted’ bitcoin transacted with ckBTC can get mixed with ‘tainted’ bitcoin, and thus get rejected by central exchanges and other parties.

As a community we need to protect honest users wishing to benefit from quick and inexpensive bitcoin transactions on the Internet Computer. Hence, we are asking the community for support in the endeavor to seek fully decentralized solutions for this problem.

Central exchanges do KYT on all transactions

When you receive bitcoin from a ckBTC transaction, send it back to the bitcoin network, and then to a central exchange (CEX) to sell it for fiat, the CEX may likely flag this bitcoin due to its AML and KYT rules. Consequently, CEXs could reject or even quarantine the bitcoin you own as it has become associated (without your knowledge and beyond your control) with an address linked to criminal activity.

For instance, [Coinbase's User Agreement](https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement/payments_europe) - Section 5.8 states the following:

“We may also refuse to process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law, regulation or any court or other authority to which Coinbase is subject in any jurisdiction, for instance, if there is suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime.”

Similar statements are made in [Binance’s User Agreement](https://www.binance.sg/en/user/agreement) - Section 2d: User Authorisations

“(d) freeze (or instruct Xfers to freeze) further credit or debit to or from the Linked Wallet due to your breaches of the User Agreement or breach of applicable law or if there is a suspicion of money laundering/terrorism financing or if there are breaches of anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism policies and procedures;”

It must also be noted that regulation around crypto is uncertain, but the trend is clearly moving towards stricter regulations and more controls. The US in particular, is cracking down more and more on the industry, aggressively levying fines and other penalties against crypto lending firms.

## Possible Solutions

1. #### Do Nothing

The most obvious and perhaps most decentralized solution would be to not react at all. Similar to the way bitcoin UTXOs are transparent and traceable, all ckBTC transactions are recorded and thus, illicit activities can be followed by authorities should criminal acts be reported. Unfortunately, ckBTC transactions cannot be reflected back to the Bitcoin network. Essentially ‘tainted’ bitcoin mixed with ‘untainted’ can cause all bitcoin transacted with ckBTC to become tainted and thus, any user of ckBTC might be unable to redeem Bitcoin received with ckBTC. Therefore, doing nothing would mean to expose honest users to the risk of their bitcoin getting blocked or quarantined by a centralized exchange.

Without intervention there is a risk that ckBTC canisters become seen functioning like a mixer with uncertain consequences. This has happened, for instance, to Tornado cash: it is blacklisted by the US Department of the Treasury, making it illegal for US citizens, residents, and companies to use.

As regulation continues to evolve around the crypto industry, doing nothing may put ckBTC canisters in the same category as Tornado Cash in the eyes of authorities in many countries.

2. #### Decentralized KYT

Know Your Transaction (KYT) is a process of evaluating transactions w.r.t. fraudulent or suspicious activity such as money laundering or illegally obtained funds. In particular, KYT providers expose APIs that can be used to identify ‘tainted’ UTXOs. Thus, using HTTPS outcalls to call KYT service APIs, the Internet Computer could implement a decentralized process to ensure ckBTC does not transact ‘tainted’ bitcoin. As many KYT service providers do accept crypto as payment, the whole process can be decentralized, i.e., the Internet Computer or the ckBTC canister could reimburse KYT providers in a decentralized way and recover costs via transaction fees. In other words, this whole process would be controlled by the NNS DAO, and therefore fully decentralized.

## Way Forward

These are just a few ideas of how the problem of ‘tainted’ bitcoin on the Internet Computer could be tackled. The DFINITY Foundation is fully committed to solving this problem in a decentralized manner to ensure that ckBTC becomes a decentralized service for transacting bitcoin in an inexpensive and fast way without exposing end users to financial risks. As KYT is a very involved process that goes far beyond checking blocklists (unfortunately, simply checking blocklists is by far not sufficient), all options must be explored in detail.

We invite the ICP Community to ponder the situation and get involved in the discussion.

I would like to say that Saorsa Labs are looking at these kind of issues. There are aspects of our ideas/ plan which are business sensitive - but I'd like to give you the heads up that we are here and we are very interested in this topic

skilesare | 2023-03-01 10:40:50 UTC | #3

Also consider where the utxo gets added after it has already been added to ckBTC. Maybe you just kick it to the back of the pay out pool, but you'd basically be freezing a portion of the ckBTC balance. I have mint checked the code, do utxos get combined by ckBTC or do they hangout in some kind of fifo/lifo queue. If the latter you could sort them by tag and have a tagging mechanism. If there were ever a run on the bank you could ask a use if they want those utxos or not.

You can not stop illicit activities, just as you can’t stop flowing water due to gravity. Water will finds its course, and illegal activities will find way to circumvent around laws and policies. 

In our societies, be it in US, Mexico, Italy, UK, Africa as a whole, Russia, Ukraine and many more…though there are laws put in place to prevent the so called criminals from participating financially, they find a way around it. They still have cartels, mafias and gangs running from countries to local counties. Let’s be honest here, that’s the state of contemporary society that we live in. And if you think otherwise you need to open your eyes to how society is organized.

So here in the IC you can’t prevent them but you can make sure they don’t pollute or contaminate the IC by designing and implementing safe gauges to prevent them from doing transactions twice. Or those accounts that have been already flagged can’t do business on the IC due to an error in finalizing the transaction; which can be the last step in the protocol for a transaction to be successfully complete. 


Say an account was reported as being illicit or illegal… then the question becomes how do you prevent the same transaction from being conducted again in the desired jurisdiction. I believe that’s the best that can happen and should be the focus of censorship of these so called illicit accounts as it would meaningfully prevent illicit transactions and create a safe environment. 

Focusing on being the law enforcer is a RED QUEENS RACE; you go so much just to find yourself in the same place. What can happen is a putting policy in place on how to prevent the same actions from happening again OR twice. Again repeating my point, the best to do is prevent them from doing that action twice. Or if it’s a flagged account already stop the transaction before it’s finalized. That’s where the focus need be. How to identify those account and prevent them from doing business on the IC should be the focus of priority that needs to be considered.

It's the latter. Once a UTXO has been processed and the corresponding amount of ckBTC has been minted, the UTXO becomes available for retrieval requests.

In that case, we would have more ckBTC in circulation than retrievable BTC in the ckBTC minter, which must never happen.
The ckBTC minter must be able to serve any valid retrieval request eventually.

There is no way to do that if one of your utxos gets tainted after the deposit.  If the depositor has withdrawn already you are stuck with a tainted utxo that can never be withdrawn without affecting an unknowning user.

One option might be to use fees to make up for any quarantined utxos, but you still have risk while you wait for catch up.

Or don't do anything. Or better yet let developers build wrapped assets and they and users can assume the risk or not.  
Remove the NNS from having to make any decision on KYT or KYC. Coolpineapple makes a very strong case why we shouldn't. See thread: https://twitter.com/CoolPineapple18/status/1630932913352065025?t=NV_tOOKgVxQ2aoIi3E1GKw&s=19

ckBTC canisters
[/quote]

ckBTC should only be seen as a mixer if the transaction history is not transparent. If the transaction history is publicly viewable, i.e. if minting/buring and ICRC-1 transfers are viewable and public then AML and KYC operators can always view this log if need be to trace BTC. Tornado Cash is fundamentally different because it is not a transparent service. 

I think the solution is to not KYT (every service provider and exchange will have different requirements, and it just will make the chain look centralised), the solution is to make sure that the ckBTC is not acting as a mixer, which it isn't if the transactions are transparent on the IC. 

So why not implement a service on the IC to track  Bitcoin transfers as ICRC-1 tokens and open source this to others. Then any service provider will be able to use the endpoint to determine if Bitcoin withdrawn from the minter originated from dirty bitcoins that came into the system. However, no gatekeeping would be necessary.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-03-01 16:26:56 UTC | #12

I agree. I think this  KYT thing is a horrible idea and will definitely make the IC look very centralized which many people already think it is, and whether the perception is true or not is irrelevant. Both #BTC and ckBTC ledger are transparent so exchanges can use their chain analysis tools to track this stuff as you stated. No need to put the NNS in control of another thing.

The Bitcoin integration and ckBTC is already controlled by the NNS, so it's the NNS DAO and NNS that could be held responsible if there is a regulatory crackdown.

I think it's prudent to get ahead of this and put in place a KYT system, where the system itself is owned by a DAO and transparent to both regulators and ckBTC users.

I'd be in favor of this KYT software system to be decoupled from the protocol itself and to go through an SNS, allowing ckBTC users, dapps, and exchanges the opportunity to invest and have a say in the software and process by which "tainted" UTXOs are defined/identified.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-01 19:29:24 UTC | #14

This would be ideal. I do think ckBTC is fundamentally different to a centralized bridge that creates wrapped tokens. Provided authorities can properly trace tokens across chains I don’t see why authorities would treat the integration as a mixer when it is not. If you can clarify this point @Jan it would be helpful in thinking through the problem. 

All that said, the thought of a DAO (the NNS) paying for a centralized service like Chainalysis KYT is kinda trippy and futuristic. Maybe that’s the future

timo | 2023-03-01 19:37:18 UTC | #15

Can someone provide an overview over how all the other Defi products on all other chains do it? Most of them must have the same problem. Whether you use an AMM, DEX, decentralized marketplace, provide liquidity, etc. it can always happen that you (or everyone) gets tainted coins out.

- Are we here to do politics ? If the world is splitted in 2 and each parts would like to give a stain to others transaction would that be helpful ? I am not sure.

- If someone steal a btc and it become stained and cant use it anymore, does that really help the person that got it stolen ?

- BTC works well and they dont do anything right ?

- We could still decide to implement it later, why such a hurry ?

Just my opinion.

delia | 2023-03-01 20:01:34 UTC | #17

Very interesting topic! In my view, staying as decentralized as possible must be key. However, I would closely monitor future regulatory developments in the industry so as to act accordingly and not risk being blacklisted and thus jeopardizing the long-term adoption of the project.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-01 21:41:31 UTC | #18

Max, while I agree with your point *in theory*, I think it may fail in practice. Getting every exchange and governing authority to understand that a "utxo changes into a transaction chain and when it gets back to a utxo it is actuall different owners" is going to be one hell of a practical challenge. 

I don't even think that icrc-1 has a hash that chains through it which we might get them to understand.(why didn't we put that in the standard?)

If ICP becomes a monster and THE web 3 scaling layer, then maybe.....but from my view here at ETHDenver "optimism is the new punk" so we still have a hell of a mountain to climb.

wpb | 2023-03-02 04:38:58 UTC | #21

I don't really see a problem with rejecting "tainted" BTC so it is never transacted with ckBTC.  It seems reasonable to keep it out of the system on the inbound side so it isn't a problem for someone else on the outbound side.  The use of KYT doesn't bother me based on the information discussed in this thread so far.

-------------------------

blabagastered | 2023-03-02 10:07:02 UTC | #22

Aave and Liquity don't do anything. I don't know about the others but I'm not aware of any that attempt any filtering. If anyone knows of any large ones please say so.

So far it seems only one protocol, Tornado Cash, has had strong backlash from a major jurisdiction. It is specifically designed as a mixer. Other mixers have not seen significant backlash, and neither have to my knowledge other defi protocols designed primarily for other purposes so far. Monero, the main privacy-preserving coin, has not seen comparably large backlash either.

-------------------------

dostro | 2023-03-03 00:36:53 UTC | #23

Centralized exchanges have this issue because they’re essentially private mixers. Assuming traceability of BTC->ckBTC->BTC, there shouldn’t be a problem. I agree with Max to focus on complete public transparency, even consider tools to make it easier.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-08 17:29:30 UTC | #24

Hey everyone, love the conversation that has been happening so far. I'm extremely involved in this and want to give my perspective:

At Toniq we've been building Bioniq for the past month. Bioniq is a BTC ordinals marketplace built on the Internet Computer. We're building Bioniq as a native BTC application, meaning we won't have ICP NFTs or ICP tokens available on the marketplace at all. ckBTC will be the native currency of the marketplace, and you will only be able to view/transact BTC ordinal NFTs on the marketplace. We are making fantastic progress, and if you haven't seen the crazy traction around BTC ordinals, we're really excited about the potential for Bioniq to bring a lot of positive attention to the Internet Computer.

In order for Bioniq to work we need a ckBTC solution, so I've been discussing with Dfinity over the past few weeks to try to come up with a workable solution that can be implemented quickly without sacrificing decentralization/security.

Over the past few weeks I've spent 20 hours on calls with Toniq AML legal counsel (Goodwin), compliance case management providers (Unit 21, Hummingbird, ComplyAdvantage), and KYT providers (Elliptic/Chainalysis) to try to come up with the best solution. The best solution in my mind (1) maintains decentralization as much as possible, (2) mitigates risk for all parties involved, and (3) is actionable and allows us to move quickly to a solution.

Just so everyone understands what I'm referring to, let me add a few definitions here:
**KYT provider**: a centralized service (like Chainalysis or Elliptic) to screen wallets/UTXOs for risky crypto assets. This can be called directly from a canister with an API key as the only centralized point.
**KYT**: know your transaction. Simply an API call to a KYT provider that returns a risk score associated with a particular UTXO or BTC wallet address.

Importantly, KYT has nothing to do with KYC. Users won't have to provide any personally identifying information to interact with the ckBTC minter. In fact, the entire process (using a KYT setup) is still almost completely decentralized. There can be many KYT providers (decentralizing the KYT process) and these can be switched out as needed (further decentralizing the KYT process). The KYT piece is really isolated to the management and rotation of an API key.

**So my final thoughts:**

First, we absolutely need KYT as part of the ckBTC process in order to mitigate risks for everyone involved. Whether you are a dApp wanting to provide a frontend interface to wrap BTC to ckBTC, or you are a user that is interacting with the ckBTC canister, or you are part of the NNS that will be governing the ckBTC minter canister, adding KYT reduces risks for everyone involved.

Second, there aren't really any additional risks by implementing KYT. You can always just get a new API key, new KYT provider, etc. These can even be added over time to further decentralize the KYT process. So we reduce risks for dApps, users, and the NNS by implementing KYT, and we don't add any additional risks by adding KYT. The KYT process will be built to minimize the reliance on any single KYT API key or KYT provider.

Finally, on top of the ckBTC KYT process (which is absolutely needed) it is likely that Toniq will need to implement a KYT solution on our own frontend. Both pieces are needed based on the legal/AML/compliance conversations I've been having.

If you have questions, you can reply here, or DM me on Twitter (@BobBodily), or you can grab a time on my calendar here: https://calendly.com/bobbodily/meeting. Thanks everyone.

[/quote]

Is this API key really a private key and the access control is signature-based and threshold ECDSA can be used? Just asking because if it was just a secret token that has to be shipped in the request then that would not work from a canister because a canister cannot reliably hold secrets.

A problem remaining with this approach could be that the risk score changes over time as new hacks and thefts become known to the KYT providers. Could this approach create an incentive to hackers to send their stolen funds directly (or as fast as possible) from the hacked source to the ckBTC canister? Then the KYT would not yet raise a flag and ckBTC would accept it. 

Well, maybe not if we are waiting for 144 confirmations. Maybe the slowness is the solution. But still, there will be hacks that aren't recognized and published in a day.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-08 19:41:09 UTC | #26

I believe it would be a secret token that has to be shipped in the request (standard Web2 API), but @Manu can confirm and discuss security risks here.

Risk score can definitely change over time, but this applies to anyone using KYT anywhere. Waiting for many confirmations can mitigate this (as you mentioned), but I acknowledge this isn't a 100% perfect solution. Perhaps it is good enough for what we need right now though.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-08 21:16:11 UTC | #27

After giving it further thought, I believe introducing KYT for the ckBTC canister would provide an incredible use case on a dApp that is both decentralized and regulatory compliant (at least in the West). Our goal with the Internet Computer is to become the Crypto Cloud. That means having tools and services that are actually used and not just crushed by the regulators. This is all the more important now that regulatory activity is heating up. 

Censorship resistance exists along a spectrum. dApps can either choose to be more or less censorship resistant and regulatory compliant depending on their desired use case. Lets say the NNS decides it wants ckBTC to comply with American regulators but not Russian or Chinese regulators requirements. That is a decision that the NNS can make. Each dApp can decide to make its own trade offs depending on the token-holders of that dApp. In the case of ckBTC, that means the ICP holders (NNS), but in the case of Openchat, that means the CHAT holders (SNS). I personally would love to see a fully on chain order book DEX that works like Coinbase and is both fully compliant in the US AND decentralized. My understanding is that this AML canister will be opensourced so other projects can use its code too. 

As is clear, even bitcoin is not fully censorship resistant because if you send tainted bitcoin to a centralized exchange like Coinbase, Coinbase will confiscate the bitcoin and report you to the authorities. Given how ckBTC works, it seems that there is simply no technical way to avoid tainting all of ckBTC if even a small tainted portion enters the mix. It is also important to note that ckBTC is not the base layer - it is an application built on the NNS. 

I urge everyone to think bigger. Imagine if we have applications on the Internet Computer that are used in the real world. It is an unrealistic fantasty to think crypto can be used in any major way without falling in line with at least some regulators. 

AGAIN, I think this block in the road is another blessing in disguise. Just like the whole casino front end being blocked caused us to reconsider boundary node architecture, I believe this minor delay in rolling out ckBTC will create new real life opportunities to bring applications on the IC into regulatory compliance that can be used in other use cases. 

The key here is that each DAO will be able to make its own decisions according to the tradeoffs. This is a no brainer trade-off I believe we should be excited to adopt.

I agree with @Maxfinity on this one.

I strongly believe that introducing KYT is an horrible path to take.

Furthermore : you are concerned about mostly US law @Jan . US is not the entire world. Crypto is mostly about decentralization among other thing.
If in their crazyness the US is marking all Russian's transactions as illegal. Are you going to enforce this ? And if next it's China that is targeted by the US, are you going to do the same ?

I'm pretty sure there is a ton of people that consider the US as terrorists because of all their bombing all around the world in the past century. Maybe then we should consider BTC transactions from the US as tainted as well ? Why Americans should be given a higher status here at the protocol level of this feature ?

BTC doesn't care, this is why it's the most trusted protocol. Going down this dangerous road is surely going to kill the awesome opportunities that this feature is giving us. First for BTC maxis and then for the rest of the world.

dymayday | 2023-03-09 22:41:15 UTC | #30

Oh and for the record, the argument "this is fine, it's almost decentralized" is bogus. If your shiny "decentralized" system is gated by a centralized authority, well then, what does it make of your system ?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-09 23:51:44 UTC | #31

Unfortunately I don’t think what Max is hoping for is technically possible.

I believe the only reason the foundation is considering this is because the architecture is such that tainted BTC can be transferred between users during the wrap / unwrap process. 

That means if you send BTC to convert to ckBTC and then convert it back to BTC you may end up with tainted BTC. And then Coinbase will confiscate it from you if you send it there. 

We do not want our users getting their BTC confiscated.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-03-10 00:21:12 UTC | #32

For starters I largely agree with CoolPineappl18's stance here. This feels like an issue way above the protocol level. Effectively, ckBTC is a service living on top of the IC... and who exactly controls ckBTC right now? Is it the NNS or the Foundation? 

Personally, I see merit in having a version of the ckBTC canister which implements KYT and I myself would be most comfortable using that version. But, regardless of the decision made here anyone can deploy another version of the [ckBTC](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/bitcoin/ckbtc) canister with their own functionality, *right*? 

Provided someone can always ship another modified version and the existing ckBTC canister is controlled by the *foundation*, I support implementing KYT into the existing ckBTC canister. Now, if thats the path we end up taking I think it would go a long way if the KYT providers were elected. Either through a market process, nns vote, something..

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-10 01:40:30 UTC | #33

This is 100% correct. 

I believe there’s another version called icBTC. If you want you can go ahead and use that instead of ckBTC and risk getting your funds confiscated, but avoid KYT. Totally your call.

If the Russians control the IC, the Americans would complain that somehow Russians are not competent due to the number of oligarchs in that country. 

If the Americans control the IC, the Russians would complain that Americans are flagging their transactions at high rate to avoid competition. And also the system of oligarchy is well alive in the US. 

The solution might be to let the Chinese dictate the flow of transactions; if we are talking about flagged accounts. 

However being African, I’d like to propose that we as Africans can dictate the terms of the flagged accounts; since Africa is well developed technologically in a decentralized manner. Africa is decentralized as the Western part Africa have their own developed system of governance, the Southern Africa region,  East Africa region and North Africa region have their own developed systems too.

What’s lacking is how to convince the world that those regions as a unit or whole are capable of regulating the power of the IC. A solution can be for the IC development team to contact the African Union and request them to develop a regulatory body for the compliance of the ckbtc as this can result to being a human crisis issue. And then the African Union can set up a body that can regulate the ckBtc. Trust me when I say that the Africans are well capable of handling such a task. Africans are neutral and do not necessarily have bias to anyone. That would be a more stable solution that would last ages. 

But if we are talking about speed, the only reasonable solution at the current time would be for the IC to comply with Chinese regulators about the flagged accounts. 

Those are my thoughts and I do have more practical solutions but it is not the right time to implement them. Or like someone had commented earlier on, the focus on the flagged accounts should come in when they become a problem.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-10 05:39:59 UTC | #35

@Jan I realized there might be another issue. Let’s say the wrapping process to ckBTC includes KYT. Ok, problem solved. 

But wait. What if one of the DEX’s on the IC creates a BTC <> ckBTC swap that doesn’t included KYT. 

Does that break the solution? @Manu @bob11

Why don't we look at what the wider ecosystem does and take inspiration from there. Just do what any other Defi protocol does that has pools.

My guess is they do nothing but are transparent, i.e. funds can be traced through the protocols. Does anyone have an overview of how all these Defi protocols handle it?

-------------------------

robert_t | 2023-03-10 08:46:45 UTC | #38

I agree, and have read through all of this wondering if what it means is that the ckBTC implementation has omitted to include this traceability, resulting in the concerns being voiced? Regulation is going to come, and go, and change depending on all manner of whims and objectives. If the architecture provides transparency and can be used to trace funds, then that's all that's needed. Adding in a blanket layer of regulation which enforces the entire IC community to be subject to regulations that probably only affect a specific subset of that community amounts to caretaking or even stewardship... make it transparent and leave it to Dapps and Dexes - individual DAOs - to consider if it's important to them.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-10 16:04:57 UTC | #39

No this isn't an issue. The ckBTC minter is the only place where ckBTC can be issued. A swap doesn't matter because BTC is not going into the ckBTC BTC pool. The swap could be implicated, but the ckBTC minter is still clean.

That is correct, it is some canisters running on the IC.
[quote="Hazel, post:32, topic:18754"]
and who exactly controls ckBTC right now? Is it the NNS or the Foundation?
[/quote]
The NNS controls all ckBTC canisters. You can see this on the dashboard ([ledger](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mxzaz-hqaaa-aaaar-qaada-cai), [minter](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai)): both have the [NNS root](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/canister/r7inp-6aaaa-aaaaa-aaabq-cai) canister as controller. So any of the changes discussed here would need to go through an NNS vote.

-------------------------

Hazel | 2023-03-10 16:36:33 UTC | #41

Gotcha, this really complicates things... I don't think the NNS should be controlling something this high up the stack. Implementing KYT restrictions here sets a really negative tone for the NNS as a whole.

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-03-10 21:46:36 UTC | #42

The way I see it it's about choosing one out of 2 tradeoffs: make it more opinionated and in the eyes of some less decentralized by integrating a KYT mechanism or keep it neutral and let services decide if and how they want to gate dirty UTXOs, the former comes with a potential for bad publicity as it might further the idea ICP is centralized, the latter comes with increased burden for devs who would have to do more work either by checking UTXOs themselves, or integrating with an external service.

The problem with the transparency argument is other chains are public by default, everyone can download all the chain's state and verify it, regulators can keep track of all trades executed outside certain dApps, e.g Tornado cash, so the "taint" can be transferred to the exchanged tokens and if tokens come from service that obfuscate txs like mixers they are tainted regardless. On the IC things are different cause subnets don't publish blocks and its up to individual dApps to make their state public and verifiable, with the current state of things even if the ckBTC canister were completely transparent, bad actors could convert tainted BTC to ckBTC, swap to ICP on a DEX, stake them in the NNS and washtrade the stolen funds by selling maturity, just to name an example.

Why were they against this? Because of the risks involved?

I’d think if anything KYT would make their lives easier from a legal perspective and give some plausible deniability. 

The application can choose to implement their own ckBTC canister (xxBTC) if they so vehemently disagree, and applications can choose how they wish to proceed.

Something tells me the majority of applications and the majority of users will choose to use ckBTC though because of it’s redeemability on centralized exchanges.

Yes, that's right David, I believe it does. ICRC-1 can become tainted at  any point, hence why KYT should be implemented by dapps themselves.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-10 23:49:25 UTC | #46

Hmm. It does not appear there is a universal solution to the problem of tainted coins. @Maxfinity and @Zane identify the wash trading example which is a good consideration and is what I was trying to convey to @bob11 but don't think I articulated it well.  

*Example - Someone with tainted BTC swaps for ICP, and then ICP is swapped for ckBTC, and then ckBTC is unwrapped for untainted BTC.* 

That said, I would still be in favor of implementing a KYT canister wherever possible for ckBTC. I think we should make it harder for folks with tainted BTC to transact, and this adding this layer would certainly add an obstacle. The regulators are coming down hard on projects now and I think we should not be taking risks that are too big, especially considering the IC is in a weaker position right now. 

This isn't really a philosophical debate because as many have pointed out ckBTC is just one instance of wrapped bitcoin on the IC. Someone else can implement a non-KYT version of ckBTC. It really doesn't matter. 

The IC should offer people options and people can opt in given their risk profile. 

Maybe the foundation offers ckBTC (KYT enabled) with 72 confirmations and ckBTC (no KYT) with 6 confirmations. Everyone is happy.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-11 01:33:17 UTC | #47

Regardless of how this turns out, it is obvious to me that the KYT canister is a service that will be used by many other services on the IC and this entire exercise will be super valuable for the ecosystem.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-03-12 14:47:14 UTC | #48

I'm not sure why this issue is worth discussing.

If ckBTC needs KYC, then I'd rather it never launch.
So far, most of the businesses that require KYC still only involve fiat currencies or payments.

Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade, and no mainstream country has laws that require KYC within a cryptocurrency system, unless you think IC is just an Amazon system!

---------
Additional explanation.

Indeed KYT is different from KYC. My understanding is that KYT is more broad-based and its cornerstone is KYC or blacklisting, which in any case should not be mentioned on the chain for these features. That should be the domain of the off-chain service to deal with.

If my understanding was wrong, I retract my comment and apologize for that!

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-03-11 22:03:44 UTC | #49

Wait, so you think we should have a debate about centralizing the 'World Computer'?

Are we going to have this conversation every time some petty tyrant threatens regulation? 

Censorship resistance, privacy, security, and decentralization should be core principles of the IC. Indeed, I thought they were.

When you find yourself contemplating an action that would undermine your principles do you seek to rationalize it or to reframe the issue?

@Jan 

The problem is that the coins which are added into ckBtc canister has to be pure (no illegal activities related to that coin)

There are a lot of analysis involved to get the relevant information whether a btc is tainted or not. 

Req 1: all btc retrieved from ckbtc canister shall be able to be selled in cex as well as dex.
Possible solution
- buying btc and adding it in the ckBTC canister are handled by the nns. It is resposnsible to provide sufficient buffer in form of btc in the ckBTC canister. But a user has to buy it from the nns.
- adding btc to ckBTC would involve more cumbersome checks which need to be performed in similar fashion as already done by DEXes. Maybe some kind of whitelist of allowed sources can be used to add btc into ckBTC.
For example, if I buy btc from binance and sent it to my btc wallet and change it with ckBTC it should allow the transaction to happen. If it is from other source the btc will be added in my wallet but the ckBTc should not allow me to perform the exchange (btc with ckbtc). Whitelist are handeled by the NNS.

- All in all if btc are alllowed to be added to ckBTC then the same procedures have to be applied as already done by DEXes (only in a decentralized manner)
- using some kind of whitelistings to restrict the source from which btc can be added into ckBTC

-------------------------

Jan | 2023-03-14 21:33:09 UTC | #56

Thank you all for engaging in this critical discussion on how to move forward with ckBTC! To reiterate, here is a quick summary:

* Opportunity: ckBTC has the potential to greatly expand Bitcoin’s functionality by enabling fast and inexpensive BTC transactions on the Internet Computer and be a killer application for the Internet Computer.
* ​​Concern: without some form of Know Your Transaction (KYT) checks, there is a risk of users unknowingly receiving “tainted” bitcoin that is not sellable on CEXs, rendering ckBTC effectively unusable for many users.

The high-level solution: As mentioned in my initial forum post and based on the multiple discussions we’ve been having with KYT providers and community members, a possible solution would be that ckBTC transactions interacting with the bitcoin network (ckBTC->BTC & BTC->ckBTC)) are first evaluated by one or more KYT providers in a decentralized manner. Ideally, the APIs should be run by various members of the ICP ecosystem with which ckBTC integrates.

For clarity, the KYT process is different from KYC (Know Your Customer). A KYT check on transactions does not reveal the identity of the user. It only tracks whether the bitcoin sent to the ckBTC canister has previously been associated with illicit activities.

KYT checks could be integrated into the ckBTC process as such: 

**Issuing**


**![|585x329](upload://hSGuwoMAWRmTYstfE8e7vxvqygU.jpeg)**

**Redeeming**

**![|607x342](upload://fTuN6h2ZAdWkw0IIHgmKsAUChim.jpeg)**


The goal is to mitigate the risks “tainted” bitcoin poses to users in a way that both avoids any further delay in the completion of the ckBTC launch in the short term, and in long term maintains a decentralized process of issuing and redeeming ckBTC. Discussions with Toniq Labs, other members of the ICP ecosystem, legal teams and various KYT providers are in progress.
 
In the short term, we are proposing that the NNS controlled ckBTC may rely on a single KYT provider. In the long-term, having multiple KYT providers will ensure higher levels of decentralization. Bob Bodily from Toniq Labs has already taken the initiative to explore solutions — hopefully more ICP community members will follow suit. 

To ensure sustainability of the approach, the ckBTC canister would use transaction fees to pay KYT providers for their services, and the parameters of these services would be decided via NNS votes. Anyone in the ICP Community interested in actively supporting this KYT initiative is more than welcome to do so. 

And as ckBTC lives in a canister and uses the underlying native Bitcoin integration APIs,  anyone can implement their own version of ckBTC and deploy it on the Internet Computer – the code is open source.  

As a last thought: laying out the foundation of such a KYT process now could prove to be highly valuable in the context of all ERC-20 tokens related to the upcoming Ethereum integration.

@Jan 
What if there is disagreement between KYT providers ? 
Does American ones always win ? But China has more people, so Chinese ones should win right ?

What if someone sends a bitcoin to the ckBTC minter and then, a few hours after, this bitcoin is marked as tainted afterwards ? This solution is then at the very least useless.

With those concerns about Occidental political matter, this is feeling more and more like : 
Internet Computer = Centralized American Computer.

The ckBTC canister is open source. You or anyone else can modify it and roll your own with a different KYT (or no KYT at all).

The IC is still decentralized, but DFINITY is the central authority that created the ckBTC canister and open sourced it, so they have an incentive for users & investors in this new Bitcoin integration to feel safe in holding and using BTC on the IC, without the worry that their BTC will be labeled “tainted” and confiscated.

If people in other countries don’t like the KYT that’s implemented they’re free to roll their own no-KYT natively integrated BTC on the IC.

Both KYT & no-KYT can exist on the IC, I don’t see the conflict.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-14 21:05:59 UTC | #61

I think the reality is that there are very few KYT providers today. I can think of Chainalysis, Ellyptic, TRM Labs...

We could design a decentralized system whereby X of Y KYT providers need to agree in order for the minting to be allowed...

-------------------------

Zane | 2023-03-14 21:15:01 UTC | #62

The problem is Dfinity's own version of ckBTC will be more adopted and unless there are major controversies around its policies it will be hard for alternatives to become relevant. 

All things considered integrating KYT might be the wrong approach to fix this issue as it'd mean stacking another layer of complexity and potential issues instead of tackling the fundamental flaw that got us here in the first place, that being the lack of transparency for subnets blocks.

-------------------------

Jan | 2023-03-14 21:38:35 UTC | #64

Thanks for pointing this out - sorry copy paste error...

There are some obvious shortcoming of KYT as you point out, and one can think of many edge cases. However, the point is that KYT providers take such things into account when ckBTC -> BTC happens and that BTC is sent to exchanges or other parties that do KYT. KYT is no exact science and there is a lot of heuristics that are applied. 

Also, to goal need to get this of the ground as quickly as possible while making sure that is it not "dead on arrival" and then iterate from there. No need to have to have the perfect solution right now, but need to have a solution that works for 99.9% of the cases and then can take it from there. If there are issues where different KYT providers have very different results, let's address it. Luckliy, with ICP this is possible!

-------------------------

Jan | 2023-03-14 21:41:17 UTC | #65

There are several options here: 1) make a small transaction first or 2) get your wallet KYT. Solution 1) can be implemented quicker. Solution 2) is tricker as it can allow for DOS attacks. Eventually both should be implemented. Again, let's start with something that works and then improve from there.

I understand the argument around if DFINITY should have spent resources to build ckBTC, but now it’s built. If they choose to build KYT and it’s a better product, bringing more people to the IC I’m all for it.

If it’s a bad/unliked product, then there’s a pretty big financial incentive (with this being Bitcoin we’re talking about) for someone to roll a different wrapped BTC standard or KYT/no-KYT.

Is every application then expected to use a library and perform their own KYT?

As the team developing ckbtc you do not have to force the developers to take a certain path. It should be universal.

The link that you provided @dfisher shows the quote below 

“
OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives. Under Presidential national emergency powers, OFAC carries out its activities against foreign states as well as a variety of other organizations and individuals, like terrorist groups, deemed to be a threat to U.S. national security. 
“ 

The concern here is that the enforcement of the ckBtc falls under US jurisdiction. It clearly states that OFAC falls under the office of the president; if I am understanding correctly. 

This is a strongly CENTRALIZED path to take as anything that undermines the US security becomes a threat. That itself is a threat to the natural free flow of the market. 

Also this approach does not allow for a level playing field as the US WOULD PUT THIER INTEREST FIRST TO EMERGE AS WINNERS IN THE MARKET!  

It should be up to developers to choose whether to abide to US law or not. 

If I develop a business and I get funded by Chinese investors, and in the long run unfortunately say that China Invades Taiwan, as a developer I wouldn’t want to be affected by US policies as they have chosen to back Taiwan. I would want to remain neutral and do business that would help humanity. But then the US might flag all developers, including myself that are funded by China if they are the aggressors. This puts developers in general on a bad position as they have to choose a super power to abide by. The best option is for the ckbtc developers to let developers choose if they want to abide by OFAC or not.

This debate is a bit of a red herring, meaning its pointless. This isn't about right and wrong. As it stands, if we do not implement KYT, then users who interact with the ckBTC canister can find themselves with tainted BTC. That means if they send their BTC to Coinbase, Coinbase WILL confiscate their BTC and erroneously report them to the authorities. Coinbase is an American company that abides by OFAC. Dfinity does not and should not facilitate and application that gets people's crypto taken away from them. It would defeat the whole purpose of ckBTC. 

That said, other people with different philosophical leanings and risk tolerances are welcome to implement alternative versions of ckBTC.  As many have already pointed out, ckBTC is one version of wrapped BTC on the IC. If Chinese developers (or Russian, or Iranian, or North Korean, or ISIS, or whoever else) want to build their own version of ckBTC they absolutely can. 

But users should be aware that if they wrap their tokens using a service that is not KYT enabled, there is a bigger chance that they could have their crypto sanctioned by a centralized exchange, many of whom follow the OFAC guidelines.   

The thing I don't really understand about this debate is that there is NO KYC. If folks with tainted BTC try to wrap their BTC, the absolute worst that can happen is that the wrapping fails. No one is coming to take your crypto away or doxx you. You'll just have to stick with normal BTC or use a ckBTC alternative. Like, what are you so worried about?

What I am worried about is the history of oppression by Americans mostly towards African Americans that can resurface as a result of the Americans taking control of ckBtc. 

As Africans we have the option of getting funds from anyone to enhance our business activities. Now while looking for our sponsors we are careful not to involve ourselves with people or entities that do illegal activities. 

However we don’t control the future of politics in the world. And as a result we do not want the future of our political views being dictated by the same people who have overseen the oppression of our own people. 

These people have their interests on the table and they know what that is. We also have our future among which is for us to choose our sponsors. By allowing ckBtc to be controlled by Americans is literally robbing us from the future of choosing on who  to do business with. Because when things go south, we would loose our funding as the ckBtc would be used as a political tool.

If peoples' BTC is taken away based on the idiotic idea of tainted Bitcoin, that is on the US government and Coinbase, not on the IC. It is like saying that every dollar note that has traces of cocaine, which most do, is tainted and therefore illegal.

The IC would not in any way be 'facilitating' such confiscation. All it is doing is offering a politically neutral way of bringing smart contracts and DeFi to BTC. It is up to consumers to do their due diligence and sue the US government in case of expropriation. 

I agree with people on the thread speaking against American hegemony. As things stand, Dfinity has decided to cut off Iranians from access to ckBTC. Why? Because the US thinks Iran is a terrorist nation, although literally no other country aside from Israel believes that. We are on the verge of blocking 90 million people based on the whims of one country.

A central strength of crypto I thought was resistance to state censorship. If, in the name of convenience, this principle is so easily abandoned, what is the use of crypto at all? Are we to be constantly beholden to the US? If so, I think a large number of the IC's Chinese developers are soon going to be moving out of the ecosystem. Makes no sense to be part of a network that is US controlled, especially since the United States has made and is making incredibly bad regulatory choices with regard to crypto.

Well there's a slippery slope between KYT and KYC. The centralized third party providing KYT service would be , likely, under obligation to report the wallet address which "attempted to" launder tainted bitcoin to OFAC. Due to sophisticated algorithms in co-operation with centralized exchanges, it is possible to narrow down the person to whom this wallet address belongs with high likelihood  of success for some cases. And therefore provides doxxing capabilities by merely doing KYT; as well as providing identifying information to ckbtc canister if so needed.

This debate is a bit of a red herring, meaning its pointless.
[/quote]

I agree with this statement... but not for the same reason. I agree because I can not, for the life of me, see why a supposedly decentralised DAO-driven and neutral WEB3 platform provider (Dfinity, in case I've confused anyone - and yes, I know) feels the need to implement a mechanism to enforce US Treasury censorship rules - rules that can and will change regularly (I wrote this before... etc) - under the auspices of protecting the community when it's simply taking some work off one or two choice Dapps who really should be dealing with this issue themselves. 

It does not belong at the platform level. At best it belongs in any Dapps that are concerned about the issue - marketplaces, exchanges, even wallets. 

The solution is simply to build in a level of traceability that would allow any authorities to track transactions through and not to implement a washer or mixer that removes this traceability. The definition of "tainted <insert token symbol here>" will change depending upon who is talking about it. 

Otherwise it seems that we're not about protecting the community but more about making sure we don't upset the US Treasury or enforcers (notice that I did not use the work "regulator" as they are not necessarily bad).

The debate is actually political and about centralization.

What happened those past few days with the crypto friendly bank failures and operation "Choke Point 2.0" had left the American crypto industry effectively bank less as of today. **This is a wake up call**.
By abiding to US laws you are effectively sending a strong message to the world that this blockchain is centralized and under the ruling of the US. But the US is killing the crypto industry in the country, so I don't think it's a smart move. 

In this context of global political changes, we are at a turning point right now and you are about to cut the "world computer" from the majority of the world as [the next bull run is most likely to come from the east](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-s-next-bull-run-will-come-from-the-east-gemini-co-founder).

In the many blockchain related events I went, I was a strong and passionate advocate for the IC (not driven by my financial gain but by what it could bring to the world) but I mostly faced lack of trust towards it and its centralization.

I'm speaking out of love for the IC and I fear that this is going to ruin it.
The US had their chance with crypto and they made their choice, let's look toward the future now.

Maybe the alternative would be to not release the ckBTC feature then and let private companies launch it under their names and let them implement whatever they want for their targeted customer @Jan . Let them shoot themselves in the foot if they want to, but let's try our hardest to keep DFinity & the IC neutral.


Let's learn from what happened in the Ethereum ecosystem with the OFAC sanction on tornado cash last year and the debacle that followed where more than 60% of the validators were OFAC compliant : it cast a massive amount of FUD about eth but it was only concerning the validators, not the core protocol itself or the eth foundation. That led Buterin to the path of developing a builtin privacy solution in the protocol itself in order to protect the network. Now we would send the opposite message...

I understand the concern of centralization/decentralization regarding the ckBTC canister. While I think that decentralization is a worthwhile goal to have, I fail to understand why having a smartcontract that depends on certain centralized service to make it feature-complete( CKBTC smart contract needing KYT centralized service) is such a big hullabaloo.

 In fact the fact that you can make a centralized smart record with the Internet Computer without changing the basic architecture of Internet Computer, which is decentralized,  is kind of amazing to me.

While, of course, i do not speak for @Jan or anyone else at Dfinity, i feel that there was a feature-miss for ckBTC. In order to make ckBTC  Canister usable in current context practically,  the inventors of CKBTC Canister feel that they need KYT. Ok. So what?

 The users/smartcontract developers may choose NOT to use ckBTC canister or interact with ckBTC canister if they feel strongly about it.

The original ask from OP was how can we collectively solve the KYT issue. One of my thoughts is that we would need some kind of risk mitigation strategy for KYT knowing that KYT would never be perfect. I am thinking about a decentralized insurance service on top of ckBTC canister implementing KYT that reimburses unforeseeable taintedness of BTC as well as provides clear documentation about how this taintedness actually happened. WDYT?

-------------------------

anonymous | 2023-03-15 13:01:16 UTC | #82

Guess we need an NNS proposal of this with Dfinity abstaining from the vote, letting the community choose.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2023-03-15 14:18:14 UTC | #83

I do not think that Dfinity should abstain, i would suggest respectfully.

Dfinity is the inventor of CKBTC Canister. In it's opinion,  the CKBTC canister is not feature complete until KYT is implemented. Therefore it is advocating for KYT at the ckbtc canister level; NOT protocol level. 

Its voting power is strength of it's advocacy.

I understand the argument around if DFINITY should have spent resources to build ckBTC, but now it’s built
[/quote]
Yes it's built but I don't see why Dfinity must be the one launching it, wouldn't it be better if the community chose which fork is the best one instead? By launching an "official" version of ckBTC first they are making it harder for alternatives.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:68, topic:18754"]
If it’s a bad/unliked product, then there’s a pretty big financial incentive (with this being Bitcoin we’re talking about) for someone to roll a different wrapped BTC standard or KYT/no-KYT.
[/quote]

This is a bit of an oversemplification imo, issues don't always arise immediately and even if they do they are often handwaved until they start doing serious damage, see Terra. In ckBTC's case if the inconveniences aren't big enough, say a small country being blocked from using ckBTC, there might never be the incentive for the ecosystem to switch to a different implementation, waiting for a disaster to happen before "minor" inconveniences can be solved seems like a bad practice to me.

[quote="justmythoughts, post:68, topic:18754"]
Is every application then expected to use a library and perform their own KYT?
[/quote]
If all subnets' blocks were public, dApps shouldn't have to do anything, otherwise yes they would either have to expose their internal ledger through APIs or implement KYT on their own, both of which aren't ideal solutions.

Manu | 2023-03-15 17:41:44 UTC | #85

I understand that not everybody is excited about using KYT providers that are centralized and follow rules set by certain governments, and I feel the same way. That being said, I think the painful reality today is that almost everybody relies on centralized exchanges because you can't pay your rent and groceries in BTC/ETH/ICP yet. For such users, I think it's important that they can use ckBTC knowing they can use the BTC they get out of ckBTC at centralized exchanges, and since those centralized exchanges use KYT checks, the only way to achieve that is to incorporate similar checks in ckBTC.

This is just my opinion, but ckBTC is controlled by the NNS, so I can submit a proposal but it's up to the voters, and others are free to submit different proposals. And separately, all code for ckBTC is open source and available under a permissive license, so anybody is free to deploy a different version of ckBTC that can take different decisions (we documented the steps to deploy this [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/mainnet)). I don't think it would be bad to have different versions of ckBTC available: I personally would want to use a version with KYT, because I am personally not affected by the KYT checks and I want to be sure I can sell the BTC that I get out of ckBTC on a CEX. However, I think it would be great if there is another version available for users that don't worry about tainted BTC and want an approach without any KYT and centralized parties. The main point I want to make is that the IC is neutral in the sense that you can run any canister you like on it, including other versions of ckBTC

I think this logic is wrong and is made to persuade the reader that a centralized entity such as US government is needed to make BTC functional. 

However if I remember correctly, there was an option to buy Tesla with BTC not too long ago.

Also there are countless ATMs across the world the US included where customers can exchange their BTC for cash and vice versa. 

The whole point of having an international infrastructure that is supposed to last generations is that it needs to avoid being used as a political tool. Hence it needs to be up to developers whether their dapps use KYT or not. It should not be a default because then only one government would control the flow of transactions.

skilesare | 2023-03-15 18:15:55 UTC | #87

Been attempting to not weigh in too much, but since we're just talking about deploying canisters here, and that is basically free, and we have a binary choice, it seems like maybe we just do both and see which one the market wants.

ckBTC can implement KYT and we can spin up a twin called icBTC or something like that is an exact copy with KYT turned off and then the market can decide?  Seems like DFINITY is keen on doing KYT, so let them do it and if you don't want kyt you can deploy your own. It may even win.🤷‍♂️

What does this even mean? 

Why can’t they deploy without KYT and if the American government don’t like it they can develop their own version of icBtc. 

Why does it have to be the other way around. Any reasoning behind this approach?

They can obviously do either.  It seems to me like they are going down the path of doing it.  As an independent foundation, they can do what they please.  The community can do the other.  If the perceived reality were the other way around I'd propose the opposite. As a US citizen, if Dom came out as anti-KYT and said they'd never do it, I'd advocate for spinning up an instance that does do it and I'd likely use that one due to the jurisdiction I live in.  They both would represent bitcoin under most use cases....people have different risk tolerance and I'd imagine a number of these are going to pop up eventually anyway.

For the record: I want to live in a no KYT world, but I don't and I'd like to get my btc out of hoc if I ever need to.  For example: ICDevs.org would prefer to get ckBTC donation with KYT so we know we can get it out. We use a US based CEX to do so. We'd need KYT.  We can still advocate for a world where it isn't necessary(or even possible).

You see, now that is a better reality to live in. If Americans like KYT they can make their own. 

Everyone else in the world is playing by their own rules and not necessarily following what America has to say. 

That offers a level playing field as developers have an option whether to add KYT or not. 

By making KYT a default in ckBtc developers do not have an option. 

By making it optional, they have a choice whether to include KYT in their dapps or not. 

And I believe that is the better approach for everyone; not just us but the generations that come after us. They should not be boxed in to following rules that were made even before they were born which would be the case if the ckBtc team chooses to add KYT.

Denis | 2023-03-15 18:55:03 UTC | #91

This proposal, along with maturity modulation, tells me that Dfinity is completely divorced from the ideology underpinning crypto and will go along with all regulations enforced in the US. If this happens, they will be building not the World Computer, but the NATO computer. There is a reasonable chance that Russia and the US will revert to an antagonism not seen since the 1960s. At that point, I can see Dfinity taking steps to exclude Russians as they are now excluding Iranians. I say this as an opponent of Iran's regime and the Russian war in Ukraine. I say this for ordinary Iranians and Russians and Chinese who have nothing to do with the bad decisions their rulers take.
Although not a huge step in itself and understandable in pragmatic terms, for me personally this is a deal breaker. If ckBTC gets introduced with mandatory KYT I will initiate my neuron dissolve and start looking for cryptos that are a better fit for my belief system.

I want to highlight my main thought: **`ckBTC` canister is a smart contract on the application layer, and there could be many, many versions of it with different rules and goals.** I see some people pick up on this and others focus on other areas, so i thought I should drop my two cents because I think to me this is the most important idea. 

Please see these quotes:

[quote="Jan, post:56, topic:18754"]
And as ckBTC lives in a canister and uses the underlying native Bitcoin integration APIs, anyone can implement their own version of ckBTC and deploy it on the Internet Computer – the code is open source.

[quote="Manu, post:85, topic:18754"]

[/quote]

[quote="justmythoughts, post:60, topic:18754"]
If people in other countries don’t like the KYT that’s implemented they’re free to roll their own no-KYT natively integrated BTC on the IC.

Both KYT & no-KYT can exist on the IC, I don’t see the conflict.
[/quote]

In short... `ckBTC ` canister (the one @Jan describes)  being developed by DFINITY with collaboration of few others is just one example of a way to use `ckBTC`. DFINITY (as the main authors of this particular canister) are proposing that the canister be "worry free" so any users who use it are not afraid they have tainted BTC they cannot use. The initial priority is the user experience.

Inversely.... this is just a smart contract, people can (and should) deploy their own to match their goals. I could easily imagine a situation where some prefer the KYT because it offers some guarantees of future liquidity (e.g. they can use the BTC on Coinbase) and I can imagine others folks who do not have such a problem of having tainted BTC so they use other canisters.

Now, I am not deaf to folks, I am well aware that some people fear "*well if dfinity does not do it this way, I do not have the time or energy to pick up the baton and do it another way.*" That is totally fair. **However it is my belief and experience in crypto, that if there is a want/demand for it, some one WILL build a `ckBTC`-like canister with different rules (e.g. no KYT).** That is why I am not worried, quite frankly. 

In my experience, protocols see this happen all the time.

In that light, i think `ckTC` is the initial experiment but the ecosystem will birth what needs to be birthed and users will use what they prefer.

Well this is not true. The priority is very clearly: *giving users of the canister the highest likelihood that when they deposit BTC or use `ckBTC` they will get BTC which has the highest probability of being used. No surprises.* 

It really does not matter to DFINITY  (or users!) why Coinbase or other CEXs do not let tainted BTC be used, what matters is that they do, which causes a risk on the `ckBTC` user.

I think (counter intuitively and perhaps ironically) you may have a loftier estimation than I do of what `ckBTC` canister and DFINITY's goals here are. The goals of *this particular smart contract* are trust (e.g. no surprises, no security holes), adoption and providing a good user experience. 

Inversely, I think I have a high belief that community will just produce the smart contracts community wants... and community will use the ones people need at particular times. Different strokes, for different folks. That is much more Web3 IMO, rather than treating `ckBTC` canister as the one shot to get this right and satisfy all the needs. I think Web3 means it is permissionless to create new smart contracts.

From all that I'm gathering from DFINITY:

We hear you guys, but we ARE going to do this. If you don't like it, make you're own version.

Disclaimer - I'm neutral on this, honestly. I'm neither for nor against it. I see the pros and cons. Not affected if it's implemented or not. I'll be happy with whichever way this goes. 

Just, think it'll be nice if there could, <small>at the very least</small>, be a temp check proposal, regardless of if DFINITY plans to listen or not.

I am not saying you implied this, but I will slightly (unfairly) piggyback off your comment to say that DFINITY does listen actively to folks, debate it, and read across socials and others what people think. I could be wrong, but i believe the risk of "tainted BTC" came from an ICP developer for example.

This is not my call, but frankly I think a temperature check proposal for a smart contract like this is overkill. I think it makes sense more for things in the replica or protocol, not for smart contracts like this. I sometimes think the dialogue around `ckBTC` was seen too much as a protocol change (which I agree SHOULD be actively debated) because it came from BTC integration discussions. But I think `ckBTC` is a smart contract canister, and it should iterate based on user feedback and usage... and there should be many!

I don't think it's necessarily overkill. More like, letting people show their opinion with their ICP, best way to show it, IMO.

Regarding the whole debate, I actually understand DFINITY's perspective. It's better to be on the good side of regulation, rather than trying to stick to the wild west mentality. I, too, would like to move ckBTC around without the worries of having tainted ckBTC going to my exchange account, risking it where I have too much to lose.

On the other hand, makes me feel slightly uneasy, knowing there would be central entities involved. Makes it seem a bit less.. DeFi. Almost a little bit like CeDeFi.

Either way, if DFINITY thinks this is the absolute best route to take, I'm with you guys. After all, the team did work hard on it.

I am not sure I understand YOUR intent.

Are you proposing that a `ckBTC` canister where users could end up (unbeknownst to them) with BTC they cannot use in exchanges to be a good experience? Are you saying that the smart contract should optimize for the experience of those with tainted BTC? 

I understand you do not like US laws, but what is it you arguing for?
