I think (counter intuitively and perhaps ironically) you may have a loftier estimation than I do of what `ckBTC` canister and DFINITY‚Äôs goals here are. The goals of *this particular smart contract* are trust (e.g. no surprises, no security holes), adoption and providing a good user experience.
[/quote]
I always appreciate your responses. I personally don't have a position on this right now, but I do think DFINITY regularly expresses exceedingly lofty goals.

@dominicwilliams recently tweeted:

*Satoshi's philosophy was: "remove intermediaries."*

Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought it was fair to point out that this particular implementation seems to disregard that philosophy.

I think I over stated how much I think it would be "overkill." I am not THAT opinionated on it TBH.

I was only (slightly) bearish on it because the tone of dialogue seemed to be very "protocol-ish" and protocol implies "this is the only way". While there could be infinite smart contracts with infinitely different rules.

I think that is very fair. We at DFINITY do aspire to lofty goals, so good point  

So i think I should clarify what is the "lofty" goal that I thought was *beyond the intent*: I think the lofty goal of creating a smart contract that deliberately has tainted BTC (leading to bad user experiences for many, many people) just to make a point about US law and neutrality was not really productive or concrete.

I do think that removing intermediaries is a valid goal. I guess in this case, the clear intermediary are CEXs (vs DEXs). I agree we need more DEXs.

I am not sure (and I am not trying to score points or ask a trick question) how DFINITY disregards this philosophy in this case. At worst, i see the smart contract shedding light on an existing intermediary (CEXs), but it did not create or worsen them. But i concede, I may be missing your point.

However, to be fair to you... I will retract my statement with the understanding that "*not liking US laws*" is unfairly broad misrepresentation of your intent, while "*not liking US laws that lead to KYT*" is more accurate. Is that right?

If so, are you suggesting that the canister just have NO KYT but maybe warn users that the BTC they get may not be able to be exchanged in CEXs? I am just trying to understand what you envision. 

Also, would you be equally concerned if a lone developer in Mexico deployed a `ckBTC`-like canister with KYT? Or would you write it off as "*anyone can deploy anything, anyone can use whatever smart contract they want*"?

My understanding is that this will

-  Validate KYT as a concept by legitimizing its use through a DFINITY built smart contract 
- Promote KYT in practice by facilitating payments to organizations dedicated to it

I understand what you mean: the idea that "validating KYT as a concept" is a tricky one because symbols and validation matter in some abstract hard-to-quantify ways.

I just think reasonable compromise is "choose all":
* DFINITY build a `ckBTC` that has high guarantees that users will get BTC they can trade (no surprises)
* DFINITY open source the work done so community can deploy their own with any permutations of rules they wish

My personal opinion (not DFINITY's) is I think the "KYT vs not KYT" debate is best solved in the market of users/creators.

If this is the case dfinity should deploy ckBtc without KYT. Then the market can react to it. 

This would cause a problem and the solution would be to take that same code and add KYT. 

Working in a different work flow locks out options as a winner is already chosen without contest; and in this case the winners would be American regulators. 

Because let‚Äôs be honest here, if the ckbtc is released with KYT there is no way to retract that. It becomes the new norm. However when problems arise the ckBtc can be deployed to add KYT on the jurisdictions that are worried about KYT.

But who will make the users who can't cash out their BTC at CEX whole when the problem arise?

-------------------------

JxBrian | 2023-03-16 02:37:13 UTC | #120

Who bailed out the banks? 

But wasn‚Äôt a promise made not to bail out banks when they crushed in 2008? Why? Because banks take your money and profit from it, but when something wrong happens they get rewarded. As a result of owning accountability they had to change policies during  not sure but I think it was Obamas era. 

Simply put; When you get into business you have to weight the risk to reward approach. And the rule of investment is don‚Äôt put on the table what you can‚Äôt lose. So if someone loses money it‚Äôs a bad investment and they should have known better. That‚Äôs just how it is. It‚Äôs a hard reality to imagine but when you have been in the market for long and lost money due to market manipulation..experience teaches you how to weigh your risks. It‚Äôs a survival mode to know how brutal the market is. Back to your inquiry, this is not a problem that has been reported by ckBtc; but rather a problem that has been imagined. It‚Äôs not significant at all unless the data shows otherwise. 
Also this creates room for insurance companies on the IC‚Ä¶ which can drive innovation and create opportunities. Developers can insure themselves that when their accounts get tainted or get mixed up or are against the rules of a certain jurisdiction they can get full money back in this case ckbtc/BTC to refund to their customers. Because what will happen is questions would arise why wasn‚Äôt Chinese regulators chosen. How can they be included because I am sure they also have people on watch for tainted Bitcoin. Then it would be ohh this government does this, that one does that‚Ä¶ blah blah blah. To avoid getting into that mess; just let the developers choose based on where they do business whether they would allow KYT or not.

Okay, what is your definition of CYBERSPACE? 

What about AUTONOMOUS CODE? 

My definition of cyberspace is a realm that has no servers and as a result no geography. KYT is very a very geographical feature which would make the IC another Amazon as a centralized geographical entity is prioritized. 

And my definition of autonomous code is a code that has no dependencies. In this case the dependency of KYT is OFAC which is an American organization. 

This to my opinion goes against the initial intent of dfinity when it was founded that aimed on prospering cyberspace and proving an autonomous infrastructure. 
But I could be wrong since i am not part of the founding team... but it could be nice if they stated what their mission was and what they are doing to abide by that mission since that was the selling point to a lot of developers in being interested on the project.

To be fair, regulation is not limited to just the US, especially in regards to AML. The EU is also very strict, too. If anything, if the problem is big enough, the tainted BTC would be a problem in both regions simultaneously. 

[Here's](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/one-of-darkwebs-largest-cryptocurrency-laundromats-washed-out) a related piece of news that we can consider tainted bitcoin.

If we did have KYT, that bitcoin would not make it's way onto the IC. If it did, it'd be bad for all of us. It's a very real possibility that something like that could happen without such measures, which coukd put us all at risk.

-------------------------

Azat | 2023-03-16 08:55:38 UTC | #125

Instead of KYT, you can make a warning message when withdrawing funds.
Neutrality must be absolute. Trust depends on this.
Partial neutrality will destroy trust, as it introduces unpredictability.

robert_t | 2023-03-16 11:58:14 UTC | #126

Or simply opt out and not use ckBTC.

-------------------------

robert_t | 2023-03-16 12:18:26 UTC | #127

This seems to have escalated nicely... and I still don't see an answer to the questions I asked what feels like an eternity ago: is there a way to follow a hash throughout the ckBTC ecosystem from the moment it's minted from BTC to the moment it leaves and is transformed back to BTC, meaning that any tainted BTC coming into the system could be traced all the way through and out again, should that be required? 

Any cryptocurrency we use could be considered tainted at any point in time, including ICP. BTC is the current regulator focus. Let's not go through this over and over again and let's focus on the platform features that we really need?

I also find it ironic that the most marketed and trumpeted feature of Internet Computer over the last few months - the feature that's been all over the socials and in interviews - is now ‚Äújust another smart contract that you can use or not, or create your own version of‚Äù. 

An observation. Nothing more.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-03-17 01:45:54 UTC | #128

It is a question of values, which is reflected not only in ckBTC, but also in most IC products.

Blockchain values.
1. The default assumption is that users are good guys. So a no-censorship mechanism is used. What if some users do bad things? Penalty mechanism after doing something through data transparency.
2. The default assumption is that power holders (e.g. nodes, developers, foundations) are bad guys. So use consensus mechanism, open and verifiable data.

IC's values look like.
1. Default assumption that users may be bad guys. So trying to implement KYT mechanism on ckBTC, users who pass the vetting are only considered good guys.
2. Default assumption is that power holders (e.g. nodes, developers, foundations) are good guys. So we have to trust KYT service providers on ckbTC?

Doing this is not just a matter of ckBTC, it's a matter of what values IC wants to demonstrate.

Implementing KYT on ckBTC is without crypto spirit.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-03-16 13:04:14 UTC | #129

-------------------------

dymayday | 2023-03-16 13:15:45 UTC | #130

I think DFinity is missing the point here, this is all about the message that this KYT is going to send to the world and not only to the IC bubble, because as it touches Bitcoin, it will reach the entire world.

The middle ground I can think of here would be that if DFinity ***really*** wants to release the ckBTC feature under its name and thinks it needs KYT in order to protect users from the US hammer, then do it. But release another version of it without KYT and promote them equally, like so you will most likely appear neutral to the world.
And neutrality is paramount for a blockchain that dreams to become the world computer.
Or don't release it under the DFinity name.

In other words : You wanted a "World Computer" @dominicwilliams @Jan , now you have a ***world*** community, and I really hope you will be up to the challenges that comes with it.

-------------------------

Severin | 2023-03-16 13:31:41 UTC | #131

I don't really have much to add, but I think some people are missing an important piece.

When we say that it's "only" the US government that considers KYT mandatory, then we forget how good the US is at exporting their policy. (Yes, some people would call it 'forcing their policy on other countries', but that's besides the point) If the US demands KYT, then a gigantic portion of the world (at the very least in economic measures) follow suit and will also demand KYT compliance.

What I'm trying to say: this is not only about US citizen/inhabitants - KYT restrictions affects a substantially larger amount of people than 'just' the US population.

Here we go again‚Ä¶ 

Think about the Monarchy system in England. 

If the Queen requires XYZ‚Ä¶ then that‚Äôs not a problem since the empire had concurred most of the world. 

See the problem here; convenience does not make a choice or option right. 

You have to think deeper about what led to the current state of events. 

So I think you‚Äôre wrong by assuming that just because the US says this is how we do KYT, then the rest of the world would blindly agree to the same principles. Mind you these decisions are made in a centralized manner and not that Americans would be in polls or election deciding on what goes in KYT or not. But it‚Äôs rather a committee that is centralized and probably with small number of people that would make that decision whether a BTC is tainted on or not. That is not a fair playing ground to rely on when doing world wide business transactions. I probably said it before but just let the developers who use ckbtc have an option of adding KYT if they want to obey the jurisdictional rules in this case if they are doing business in the US. And the feature should not come as a default.

Sormarler | 2023-03-16 17:00:32 UTC | #136

I understand the issue at hand and appreciate the fact that we are discussing it. However, I am perplexed as to why we have just become aware of this problem now. Additionally, this puts the NNS in an awkward position where they have to make a decision. The management of ckBTC should not be the responsibility of the NNS. Independent entities could have created it and determined whether or not to implement KYT. I believe that Dfinity is not giving the community enough space to develop solutions and compete with each other. Developers need the freedom to build these verticals. If people know that Dfinity is already working on something, they may not bother building it themselves.


Let someone else build this thing and they and their users can assume regulatory risks. Why subject the DAO to this risk at all? $ICP is already regarded as centralized by many, why bring KYT  and  give competitors  more ammo?

I respect and appreciate a lot of your work @bitbruce so I definitely think you are intellectually honest person who is sharing what they see. While I still think this conversation is a bit of a red herring, (as I have stated: I think there should many, many smart contracts with different rules and goals), I do respectfully disagree on some things so I will address the assumptions you have.

> * Default assumption that users may be bad guys. So trying to implement KYT mechanism on ckBTC, users who pass the vetting are only considered good guys.

1. I can see what you mean, but the default assumption is NOT that users are bad guys and that only "those who pass vetting are good guys". A more accurate interpretation would be:

* The assumption is not that the good guys are those who pass "vetting". The assumption is that users who find out (through no fault of their own) they cannot use the BTC in many exchanges in many countries would see it  as a very poor experience. There is no moral condemnation of the users with tainted BTC.... just mitigating the bad experience for users who use the canister.

* DFINITY does not think users are "bad guys". The closest to that statement would be the very common assumption that crypto/web3 is an adversarial environment, so security reviews, attack vectors, etc... are constantly evaluated with trade-offs. In this particular case, I would not call it an "attack vector", but I would call it a "poor or surprising experience for many people".

> * Default assumption is that power holders (e.g. nodes, developers, foundations) are good guys. So we have to trust KYT service providers on ckbTC?

I do not think this is true at all. The assumption is NOT that KYT providers are good guys. The assumption is that there are USERS who are willing to trade KYT for a little more guarantee that their BTC can be used in many places. This does not mean that DFINITY agrees or disagrees with the policies of companies or countries, it means it is recognizing them and providing users a choice. 

**Inversely... and I have to repeat: the intent is that the code is public so people can launch whatever version they want for their own uses. That is the beauty of web3.**

Ironically, I think i have a lower estimation or value of institutions or organizations than I think some folks may presume. In my mind, I wonder how much people would care if a lone developer launched a canister with KYT. I assume some people would use it and some would not. Now, I do think treating DFINITY with the permissiveness one would treat a lone developer is a bit naive... clearly DFINITY has some leadership and symbolic value in the community, but I also think we sometimes go towards the opposite extreme where we ascribe TOO MUCH symbolic value to what DFINITY does, specially when DFINITY providers developers and community the tools to do different versions of any opinions (as in the `ckBTC` case).

**Personally, I can very much see why many people would not want to use a canister with KYT. I do not fault people for avoiding such a smart contract. I also think many people just want more guarantees of liquidity (cant fault those people either).** 

I just do not think we will end up in a world where:

a. People want to use `ckBTC`-like functionality...but no one else develops another version (I think community will iterate).
b. `ckBTC` canister has 0 usage because of KYT... and no one iterates or develops a more popular version.

Both would be surprising to me, tbh.

The non-fungibility of BTC is a bug, not a feature, remember!

If you tried to introduce Zcash in the IC, let's say ckZEC, you would not even have this problem!

I know the market has chosen BTC but in general terms I would say: first let's solve the serious bug (i.e. use ZEC) and only then we can proceed further.

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-17 13:18:30 UTC | #141

@diegop @Jan @Manu I completely understand where you're coming from with this proposal. I also understand that it is an open network and anyone is free to deploy their own canisters. I'm good with all of that.

I do wonder why ckBTC is being managed by the NNS if it is just another canister. I had a brief but interesting twitter discussion with @bjoern the other day about what makes a canister part of the protocol vs. just being another service.

https://twitter.com/lightning_lad91/status/1631064252692742146?s=46&t=UecZbluuy4YeOQfXaNkH-g

My layman takeaway was that certain canisters like the Bitcoin canister, root canister, etc. have special privileges to protocol level APIs that other‚Äôs don‚Äôt have. Canisters like ckBTC don‚Äôt have any special privilege so they aren‚Äôt considered a protocol level canister.

That being said, I go back to my question of why canisters like the ckBTC canister are deployed and managed under the control of the NNS. This status gives these products a level of credibility and users could perceive them to be something more than they are. It also puts a burden on NNS stakeholders to govern a DFINITY product that isn‚Äôt really part of the protocol.

Might it be worth considering having DFINITY spawn their own SNS to manage products like ckBTC that don‚Äôt qualify as being core features of the protocol? This way we help maintain the division between the DF and the network itself.

-------------------------

Manu | 2023-03-17 13:41:12 UTC | #142

That's a very good question. I think it's mainly for pragmatic reasons: the NNS is the biggest and most secure DAO on the IC. The downside is indeed that NNS voters now have the burden of voting on upgrades for this canister. 

What are the alternatives? 
1. You mention an SNS, but how would that work exactly? Would there be a new governance token for the SNS that governs ckBTC? Who would hold that token? Where would its value come from, why would people want to have it? If it is not valuable enough, then a hostile takeover to steal the BTC is possible. 
2. We could consider some multisig setup, technically very simple, but then who would be the signers? 
3. Blackhole, no controller. This rules out any further upgrades (outside of fully switching over to new canisters) which makes it very difficult to make further improvements after installing the canisters. 

I'm curious to hear your thoughts @LightningLad91. Note also that it's of course possible for the NNS to give away control of ckBTC to some other controller via a proposal if the voters want to do so (not sure if this is 100% readily available but definitely possible).

Thank you for the response @manu. I'll try to do my best to answer. Please know that I have no experience with finance or running a business so this is just me trying to come up with an approach that seems reasonable.

[quote="Manu, post:142, topic:18754"]
the NNS is the biggest and most secure DAO on the IC
[/quote]
I agree this is the case and I think there are many projects that would love to benefit from this level of security and exposure. However, since DF is just another contributor (granted, the largest) it is my opinion that their products should have to work with the same tools as other organizations that contribute to the network's development and growth.

[quote="Manu, post:142, topic:18754"]
You mention an SNS, but how would that work exactly? Would there be a new governance token for the SNS that governs ckBTC? Who would hold that token? Where would its value come from, why would people want to have it? If it is not valuable enough, then a hostile takeover to steal the BTC is possible.
[/quote]

I was actually thinking of something more along the lines of a DAO that governs all of the DFINITY's future non-protocol products and not just ckBTC. Re: value of the token, I do think there is value in being allowed to more directly influence DFINITY's development plans and roadmap. I think there are many devoted followers, both developers and users who wholeheartedly believe in DF's vision and would be willing to participate in a DF SNS decentralization sale. 

Alternatively, is it not possible to have an SNS whose governance tokens are bit more controlled so that DF can choose who to distribute them to? Perhaps they could be divided proportionally amongst the DF executives and their employees and used purely for governance without any implied monetary value.

I don't believe either of these would be ideal at this time so I won't try to justify them. :slight_smile:

Maybe Dfinity can take ownership. KYT will then clearly be Dfinity's choice, not the IC's. This will allow the IC to remain geopolitically neutral.

I sometimes think the dialogue around `ckBTC` was seen too much as a protocol change (which I agree SHOULD be actively debated) because it came from BTC integration discussions. But I think `ckBTC` is a smart contract canister,
[/quote]

To piggy-back off of this - the ckBTC canister is on an application subnet (one of the new fiduciary subnets), and NOT on an application subnet. This means that the application pays cycles just like any other canister and is not at the ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù level.

The code is open source, which anyone can find here https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc.

DFINITY will be doing the majority of the work here, so it's not THAT hard for a developer to take the code, strip out the KYT, and spin up a nice UX/DevX in front of it.

[quote="LightningLad91, post:141, topic:18754"]
I do wonder why ckBTC is being managed by the NNS if it is just another canister. I had a brief but interesting twitter discussion with @bjoern the other day about what makes a canister part of the protocol vs. just being another service.
[/quote]

That being said, I don't believe that the the ckBTC canister should be managed by the NNS. It should be a DAO of it's own (maybe SNS), with investors that dictate the direction of the KYT portion and other features.

Tagging @dymayday @JxBrian @Jonathan @Maxfinity @bitbruce and a few others. This is a huge opportunity for the community, at little development cost (although you will be taking on large regulatory risks).

In fact, I'm 95% sure at this very moment @spnrapp or some other projects are doing this exact thing, so you won't have to wait long for a no-KYT ckBTC canister.

I don't have much to add, but wanted to say that I both like and am eager to see where the thread between @Manu and @LightningLad91 goes. I appreciate the honest discussion of trade offs about the canister governance.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-17 21:38:54 UTC | #149

We had some discussions at ETHDenver about dropping an SNG (SNS governance) to every neuron at some date based on VP. Maybe also to ICP holders?  To claim you need to submit your principal which we can use to rebuild the ledger in an ICRC3 style with principal/subaccount.

Then, orgs and citizens that feel it is a violation of their local laws to approve SNS tokens can divest their tokens to other users that want the SNS voting power.

Whether ckBTC goes under this governance is another discussion.

What if the ckBTC were itself the governance token?

Owners could then democratize their own KYT by voting on the providers they want to adhere to or those they want to give the boot. This will give them leverage over abusive KYT orgs and even enable them to label what is dirty and what is clean on a case-by-case basis themselves. Or they could construct their own crowdsourced listing and ignore KYT orgs entirely.

This way the KYT is internally controlled, managed by the parties who care most about BTC, and immune to hostile takeovers.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-03-18 06:10:03 UTC | #151

I fully agree with @Zane and the others on this matter, the default ckBTC canister should be kept non-KYT in order to maintain it a neutral token that doesn't pander to any specific government. Then developers concerned with US regulations should build their "usBTC" version, those concerned with regulations coming from China should build their "chBTC" version and so on. 

After all IC is about decentralisation, no?

-------------------------

CoolPineapple | 2023-03-18 16:47:03 UTC | #152

I want to echo and extend @LightningLad91 's point that application level canisters should not be managed by the NNS.

I don't believe the NNS should be making decisions about application level things.

1. It undermines the neutrality of the platform and discourages third parties from developing applications.
1. It increases the legal risk to NNS participants. 
   * If we vote to not implement KYT. Then by virtue of having 8 year locked neurons I am forced to be part of a joint enterprise that could be accused of facilitating money laundering and sanctions evasion. Given what happened to Alexey Pertsev this is a very serious matter.
   * If we vote to implement KYT we have shown that we have the willingness and ability to intervene in application level things. We will come under more and more pressure from authorities and other actors to act to freeze assets under our control including both ckBTC and IPC. We open ourselves up to personal liability for both action. (holders of frozen assets could sue the NNS) and inaction (owners of stolen assets could sue if we fail to stop hacked funds moving).

I am comfortable voting on protocol level stuff but I absolutely do not want to be responsible for application level stuff like ckBTC.

 I would therefore prefer  either :slight_smile: 

* The option as suggested by @skilesare where Control of ckBTC and other application level things to be passed to separate SNS (s). The tokens controlling these applications should be airdropped to NNS participants / all IPC holders with no enforced lockup so that we have the opportunity to divest ourselves of liability and responsibility and not be forced to participate.
* The code for KYT implemented but the ckBTC canister shut down and it left to the community to launch different kinds of ckBTC and the freemarket to decide.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-18 17:19:43 UTC | #153

I'll say this about the SNS and what the DFINITY team has pulled off: A few weeks ago, trying to do something like this would have been hard. With the SNS tooling, it looks like it might be fairly easy now. That is good engineering and a real accomplishment! 

These issue are stressful and a pain to deal with, but they are worth solving and figuring out how to deal with successfully, powerful tech is a great problem to have.

anonymous | 2023-03-18 18:22:15 UTC | #154

The more this conversation goes on, the more ckBTC seem less of a Bitcoin "twin", which dfinity makes it out to be.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-18 19:21:24 UTC | #155

I do not think it makes sense for Dfinity to cede control at this moment to the ck SNS holders. 

Realistically, even if there are new SNS tokens Dfinity will just hold a majority of them. So it‚Äôs not going to help getting Dfinity out of any legal troubles that arise. 

They are not going to cede control of the ck canisters to the community to avoid legal troubles unless they perceive that risk to be large enough. 

To the extent Dfinity wants to build a trusted application, I think it makes total sense for it to be NNS controlled. 

To the extent Dfinity wants to cede control only then does it make sense to spin it out. It is clear it does not want to cede control of the ck canisters at this moment in time.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-18 19:37:28 UTC | #156

@dfisher the recommendation to separate ckBTC from the NNS wasn‚Äôt intended to take away control from DFINITY or protect them. If anything it would make it easier for DFINITY to make their case without others accusing the network of being centralized.

 It‚Äôs about keeping NNS stakeholders from being responsible for the governance of applications that aren‚Äôt part of the protocol.

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-03-18 19:48:58 UTC | #157

Disclaimer (since it has been counting in the debate) : I precise that I am not an US citizen. 

There is no contradiction about describing the CkBTC as a twin of the BTC. ¬´ Twin ¬ª does not mean similar (similar meaning ¬´ perfectly analogous ¬ª) or a fortiori identical. 

In my humble opinion. If users want a no censurable BTC, they can directly use BTC. We can not ask CkBTC to be the BTC on the IC. We can‚Äôt evaluate the CkBTC through the same BTC‚Äôs criteria and ideals. The purpose is different : by using it, we want to get some capabilities we don‚Äôt have with BTC. But BTC does not have head office to sue, ICP, through Dfinity, has one, so we must be more cautious. At least for now.  We can‚Äôt just want the plus without the minus here.  

With CkBTC, as it is designed by Dfinity which is currently nuclear (some folks would say ¬´ a point of failure ¬ª) for the IC , we will eventually have to comply with regulation more than if we were on BTC, and clearly the regulation will sooner than later harmonize. So Dfinity‚Äôs CkBTC must be compliant with the regulators to avoid any systemic risk for IC. The BTC on IC is currently Dfinity‚Äôs one, but BTC on IC does not have to be Dfinity‚Äôs BTC : they proposed one, and can‚Äôt challenge regulation with it or with any feature, and I would be terrify that they want to or that they don‚Äôt evaluate the risk of breaking the lawS. But anybody can implement their own BTC version, compliant or not compliant, and everybody will make their choice. But with this one, in my opinion, we can‚Äôt take a chance. Still, CkBTC is definitely not the last word for BTC on IC, it is the first, but the Dfinity‚Äôs one, and they have to be irreproachable, for them and for us, because at the end of the day, metaverse or not, cyberspace or not, we live in the real space with laws governing the real people in real countries, and they‚Äôll be always here.

To me, want a neutral CkBTC whereas the CkBTC is by design not neutral (not to be neutral is not always a bad thing and can be necessary), is a contradiction that misplaces its function and more globally the achievements which remain to be accomplished on the IC.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-03-18 19:42:44 UTC | #158

I don't think DFINITY has any desire to shut down the ckBTC canister as too much time and money was spent promoting ckBTC on different IC platforms. I think the most we can do is push for DFINITY to keep ckBTC neutral and let other developers spin new versions that cater to the whims of each government as necessary. This would not only make it fair to every IC user in the world but by leaving it up to the market to decide the winner will also possibly lead to more innovations due to competition between the different versions.

-------------------------

OVVOVVO | 2023-03-18 20:22:15 UTC | #159

From my perspective, the fact that the IC allows for on-chain computing, end-to-end, makes it by far the most decentralized blockchain protocol in the world. No other blockchain can claim such a degree of decentralized function.  

Roll-ups and oracles are intrinsically centralized functions that enable all the other major blockchain players to do business, That's no secret, and there is no complaint about this from the worldwide blockchain community.

Therefore, I don't see ckBTC compliance with KYT as a legitimate accusation that the IC will become more centralized, or even viewed as more centralized by future developers or companies that will choose the IC as their blockchain platform of choice.  

Dfinity is responsible for the progressive development of ckBTC - let them develop it as they see fit.  And (not "but") let another developer create their own version of non-KYT compliant ckBTC.

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-20 12:57:21 UTC | #161

First, I would like to comment on the discussion process so far.

Introducing KYT may not be the best But it is understandable that the risk is that the state action will spoil the BTC integration „Åó„Å¶that has been achieved for a long time.

Whichever path NNS choose, I respect.

But either way, DFINITY must understand that no matter what measures it takes, it is inevitable that it will face similar problems like this one. (The safest and best measure is to blank CKBTC üò∂)

The public mint of ckBTC is still closed and cutting off ICP's possibilities...do we have to debate for days with the same uncertainty during ETH integration?

I would like to see ICP grow first and foremost. No state will care about ICP now.

-------------------------

Mercury | 2023-03-20 16:29:21 UTC | #162

I‚Äôve briefly looked at some KYT providers, haven‚Äôt come across any that provides a pricing page, which is a bit concerning at least for me. As an alternative, if the BTC is purchased by credit-card from a non-DEX (prefer to not call it CEX), would that BTC not be KYC‚Äôd by the selling entity, i.e.Coinbase and the like? And if so, would it be technically possible, and also vetted by DFINITY, to allow those sorts of pre-KYT‚Äôd BTC be whitelisted/allowed as an interim solution to not have founders like myself get stuck with a ckBTC based project? Cheers.

-------------------------

Mercury | 2023-03-20 16:29:37 UTC | #163

Apologies if the following has already been answered: Is DFINITY not considering to take KYT services from an established KYT provider to resolve this for good? Arguably, from a (legal) liability stand point, given that IC/DFINITY is (indirectly) a business leveraging BTC as a part of its product/service offering, should it not solve the KYT issue at the point of entry of BTC into its system? Maybe someone who has a law degree can chime in, as my background does not qualify in this topic at all. I sincerely hope this can be resolved as soon as possible, and I‚Äôm sure lots of teams are hard at work on this blocker. Cheers.

-------------------------

Jan | 2023-03-20 21:03:08 UTC | #164

Based on all the comments in this thread, there are solid arguments for having and not having KYT services implemented into the design of ckBTC. While many solutions similar to ckBTC are possible on the Internet Computer, DFINITY will propose one path forward and keep an open mind as a community to iteration and optimization as the journey continues. So without further delays, the next steps to complete the ckBTC rollout with a KYT solution will start this week.

TDLR;

* DFINITY will submit a proposal to upgrade the ckBTC minter canister (mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai) in the coming days.
* The canister upgrade will remove whitelisting and make converting BTC to ckBTC available to all principals.
* The ckBTC minter canister will make calls to a newly installed KYT canister to check for ‚Äútainted‚Äù bitcoin before minting.
* With this proposal ckBTC will be fully live, and the rollout complete.

Once again, the possibilities of ckBTC are endless, which is why releasing it with its full functionality as soon as possible in a way that provides a secure user experience is crucial. Incorporating KYT checks to the ckBTC process protects users from receiving ‚Äútainted" bitcoin and ensures that their bitcoin remains exchangeable on CEXs.

Implementation of KYT Checks that will be submitted as proposal to the NNS

Issuing: KYT checks are done on all incoming bitcoin UTXOs before ckBTC is issued. More specifically, the ckBTC minter canister will be able to call a Chainanalysis KYT canister to perform KYT checks using HTTPS outcalls.

Redeeming: Outgoing BTC transactions (when ckBTC is redeemed) are checked against a hard coded OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) list. In the future, DFINITY plans to submit another proposal to use the KYT canister to also check the receiving bitcoin address when converting ckBTC into BTC.

About the KYT Canister

The KYT canister is to be handed over to the NNS, which means future updates to this canister will only be possible via NNS proposals. The KYT canister will accept a Chainanalysis API key from a designated principal. Initially, this designated principal ‚Äì which is able to update the API key ‚Äì will be controlled by Toniq. Changing the designated principal or adding other ones will be via NNS proposals.

Toniq has a subscription with Chainalysis and will pay for these calls. The ckBTC minter canister collects transaction fees that will be used to pay the designated principal(s) (for now just the one controlled by Toniq) for the KYT service. These fees are added to the conversion fees.

Next Steps

Acceptance of the proposal that will be submitted later this week means that the ckBTC rollout is complete. The ckBTC canister will be upgraded to allow all principals to convert BTC to ckBTC. And the KYT checks will allow users to securely transact bitcoin on the Internet Computer. In the future, the KYT canister may also manage the accounting for how the API key holder will be paid in ckBTC for providing a valid and active API key.

Vision

Many in this thread have questioned the values of the DFINITY Foundation and perhaps believe that incorporating KYT services compromises the decentralization of the Internet Computer. To this point, I can only reiterate that what is being proposed now is just ONE version of ckBTC. As the ckBTC canister is an application-layer smart contract, meaning NOT integrated in the protocol, there could be multiple versions of ckBTC on the Internet Computer, each with different rules and processes with or without KYT checks. The code is open source and the steps to deploy it are documented [here](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/tree/master/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/mainnet).

As we navigate as a community through such challenging situations, decentralization remains the number one priority. Moving forward the vision is to have multiple KYT providers and API key holders as well as multiple ckBTC variants, including non-KYT canisters controlled by the NNS. While the ckBTC canister is currently controlled by the NNS, this could change in the future, e.g., to be controlled by an SNS. However, that will require a thorough design and take time to implement. For now, control by the NNS is the most secure and also fastest way to move forward.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-20 21:58:36 UTC | #165

Thanks Jan. Seems like we are almost there! 

Practically speaking, how will one be able to convert BTC to ckBTC? Will it be enabled in the NNS front end at the same time as the feature is rolled out or will DFINITY rely on third party front ends to do the minting?

A wise person accepts the decisions that they have no control of; it is with that premise that a lot of developers would still keep using the IC despite the KYT decision. However the dfinity team might need to ready periodically to answer questions about tainted BTC as new concerns arise. This might be due to new comers in the ecosystem not understanding the reasoning behind the ckbtc canister implementing KYT. Like personally I have a concerning question.., what does it mean to be hard coded to OFAC? Does it mean OFAC had a list of tainted BTC that was used in the ckbtc code? Does it mean that OFAC list is updated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or on occasion per business need?

Also does that system have a future of having multiple agencies for the KYT canister; in such a way that there can be more than one regulatory body.

Yes, the ckBTC canisters are controlled by the NNS, so the only way to upgrade them is via an NNS proposal.

The NNS only controls upgrades to the ckBTC canisters. The ckBTC minter canister calls the KYT canister to screen a transaction whenever a user wants to convert BTC into ckBTC. The KYT performs the checks by using https outcalls to the chainalysis API, and returns the answer to the ckBTC minter. The ckBTC minter then proceeds to create the ckBTC for the deposited BTC.

I think it's definitely possible that we reach a place where we have eg 3 distinct KYT providers, such that 2 out of 3 decide, but no individual entity may block a transaction. Using different compliance checks for different users will be more difficult though: since the bitcoin backing ckBTC is pooled, we can't have different screening rules for eg users from region A vs users from region B, because user A may retrieve the bitcoin deposited by user B. If we want to go in this direction, I indeed think having multiple instances of ckBTC is the best path forward.

[/quote]
Correct. When you have ckBTC, you can ask to convert it back to BTC at a specified bitcoin address. The ckBTC minter will check if the specified address is on the OFAC sanctioned entities list, and if so, reject the call. The user can then of course try again with a non-sanctioned bitcoin address. In the future, we plan to use wallet screening from the KYT provider here, such that the hardcoded list does not need to be updated super frequently.

I was reading this and thought it was reasonable and something I can get behind till I read the "Toniq has a subscription with Chainalysis and will pay for these calls." 

Does this mean there will be a single point of failure with Toniq? 

What if their subscription ends?

-------------------------

Manu | 2023-03-21 08:58:44 UTC | #170

They are paid per request made, so they are incentivized to keep this subscription going. In case they would stop doing the work, the NNS can upgrade the canisters to use a different KYT setup.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 09:46:24 UTC | #171

Incentives change, we're assuming Toniq will always be in ICP

also I don't know what the implications of this running out are, then waiting till the NNS can upgrade the canister, no user impact? 

Besides, isn't the whole Idea of ckBTC to remove unnecessary third party risk? 

Is there a reason this isn't coming from NNS directly or even Dfinity (Not the best solution but still better than third party)?

Better yet, we can submit a proposal to the NNS to handover the development of ICP to Toniq and fund them with DFINITY treasury.


Many are confused about the development and governance process of this protocol. Its only reasonable for users to know that DFINITY has already decided they‚Äôre paying ckBTC fees to toniq for gatekeeping ckBTC canister.

You might consider this small but is big enough to campaign for public awareness over this

You guys are smart, you know the obvious problem with this 

1. Why do we now have to rely on a third party to manage a component of ckBTC? 

2. (Sorry in Advance Toniq) We all know the period of non response from toniq to projects last year - if there are issues which Toniq needs to be present to solve - what then? They're a self admitted small team unable to focus on all of their deliverables - Cronics investors are pissed that they cant deliver their promise of the game when a lot of ICP was put in by investors at PEAK bull run and now we want to add them as a layer of reliance on ckBTC, an essential chain level service 

3. Toniq gets paid per Transaction - I can basically Guarantee that other builders on this eco will BID for lower payment. Not saying this is what you should do, but what makes Toniq special? Someone in Dfinity trusts them? 

   Isn't trust what we're trying to eliminate? 

4. Dfinity already has control of ICP(Lets not argue semantics) - so it really doesn't make sense why at WORST Dfinity controls the subscription?

    a) It doesn't really increase the number of parties needed to be trusted 
    b) You definitely can afford it 
    c) Dfinity is the strongest of all the stakeholders on ICP - at this point, you literally ARE ICP 
    d) If there are issues - you can move faster and turnaround time is quicker 

5. Why cant the NNS control it? is there some barriers to this? 

6. What exactly is the impact if subscription runs out? 

7. How long is the turnaround in case it runs out and we have to essentially DEFINE another KYT at that point, design and release? 

8. What happens in the mean time to people who hold ckBTC or people who are reliant on services using ckBTC and need to mint? 

I hope this gets the attention it deserves before it goes to a proposal 

Hope everything I've mentioned is reasonable talking points

@Manu @Jan is any of this going to be adopted via governance proposal or is DF sticking with technical proposals?

I understand that the current ckBTC canister design was adopted before deployment; so I can see an argument for just using technical proposals.

Am I understanding your statement correctly; DF is planning to set the NNS as the KYT canister controller without requesting stakeholder approval via governance motion proposal?

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-03-21 10:25:50 UTC | #175

Great questions. I am as equally puzzled why Toniq is involved at all in this set-up.

Mercury | 2023-03-21 11:07:27 UTC | #176

TL;DR: Thx! Also m-to-n please :)
First, congrats on the KYT resolution, and fasttracking this issue. This is especially something to celebrate for startups w/ short runways remaining, in an economic downturn, who've bet it all on BTC@IC. Kudos to DFINITY for coming this far. Now the constructive critisim, if i may: Why Toniq (or any single corp.? Most of us know how the foundations work in Switzerland and elsewhere, thereby limiting what a foundation can and cannot touch. For example, for Polkadot, there are two entities: Web 3 Foundation in Zug, and Parity headquartered in Berlin, similar duos for all the big names out there. What's the equivalent for DFINITY, is it Toniq, maybe it is, I just didn't know. Within the foundation legal framework, a vetted entity or set of entities (nothing against Toniq of course) that will by default be on IC&DFINITY's side 24x7x365, no matter what happens, in my humble opinion, should ideally have KYT 3rd party subscriptions with multiple providers. The multi-provider approach is also for technical reasons, for non-adverserial purely technical risk mitigation, for example no respectable service provider relies on just one 3rd party provider etc, Chainanalysis going down shouldn't bring ckBTC down, there are other high uptime & credible KYT service providers out there. I believe in DFINITY, I'm certain they'll do the best for us, we're all on the same boat. Regards.

I mentioned how Dfinity can decentralise HTTP out-calls, they need an API key per node. Each API key can be held by a different party, they have yet to acknowledge that HTTP outcalls are not decentralised without this feature.

-------------------------

robert_t | 2023-03-21 12:15:51 UTC | #178

With all due respect, if Toniq need KYT for whatever they're building, then they should pay all subscriptions needed for that product. This has nothing to do with Dfinity or any of the rest of us. Toniq needs should be met by Toniq. Basta.

If Dfinity have a need for an API key or subscription (regardless of whether we agree or not - I've left that debate) then Dfinity should pay for it and manage it. Basta.

I fail to see why Dfinity relying on Toniq to maintain this subscription is a good idea - unless it's being implied that Toniq are somehow linked to the provision of the ckBTC canister, which I believe they are not.

This is a risk for Dfinity and anybody using the ckBTC canister or intending to support ckBTC. That risk should be covered by Dfinity and not by another third party, whether Toniq or anybody else, unless that third party is responsible for the ckBTC canister.

Denis | 2023-03-21 13:26:55 UTC | #179

At Genesis the one part of the ecosystem I was most optimistic about, where the IC had a huge advantage out of the box, was NFTs. And Toniq had a headstart as the leader in that space within the IC. Nearly two years later, Entrepot is ranked 471 in marketplaces and the IC is not even mentioned on the home page of the dappradar NFT marketplace tracker where two dozens blockchains are listed:
https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces
The failure to build a thriving NFT ecosystem is for me the single greatest disappointment of the IC to date, and the biggest proof that great tech does very little good by itself.
Why give Toniq such an important responsibility, although I have no doubt about the the organisation's sincerity of purpose? It sounds so ad hoc: someone has a subscription to a service so we will just entrust this important job to them.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-03-21 13:47:08 UTC | #180

A couple questions and points:

Why is the screening process different for BTC -> ckBTC and ckBTC -> BTC? Why a KYT provider for incoming but a hard-coded list for outgoing?

Was there legal research done behind the scenes to get to this design? Can you publish the research so that we the NNS voters can also make informed decisions based on the research?

The biggest concern I had as I was reading the final proposal a few comments back was the Toniq dependency. This seems strange. I understand it's probably quite difficult to overcome the single API key and need for a subscription from a single legal entity, but can we have this discussion and try to come up with a better design?

For example, imagine a simple round-robin or random beacon-based design that chooses from a list of canisters that have legal entities with KYT provider accounts and API keys. Each entity on the IC wanting to provide these services could register with the ckBTC or KYT canister. Registration would prove an active API key with a provider. Then on each request to mint or redeem, one of these providers is selected and the fees are paid. If we had a handful of entities this would obviously remove central points of failure, and allowing anyone to create one of these KYT API provider canisters would perhaps allow us to create a market for it.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 13:52:32 UTC | #181

There is also the issue of vetting these KYT providers to make sure they're doing what they claim - but that's probably one for after we agree on approach

Love the idea

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-21 13:55:18 UTC | #182

I think we need an answer as to why the Foundation chose Tonic. But the defeat at ICP NFT is irrelevant to the current agenda (it is the infrastructure that prevents ICP NFT from behaving like EVM).

CCC, Hatch, canistore... There were many marketplaces. What happened to those? 
I don't think the foundation loves Toniq, I think it trusts Toniq's track record of being the best contributor to the foundation's ecosystem from the past 2 years to today.

Giving rolls to members who can take action is also a DAO, it is not centralized.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 14:01:17 UTC | #183

Yeah no, forget choosing toniq, choosing anyone is a single point of failure 

We LITERALLY have a DAO to make choices(NNS), wouldn't consider Dfinity giving out roles at its will is a DAO or decentralised...

Also Trust is literally what Web 3 aims to remove, so "Yeah we trust em" seems a terrible reasoning to allow a weak model to go through 

As to the views on ICP NFT market, irrelavent - Replace "Toniq" with "XXX" and all the same questions remain.

-------------------------

Berg | 2023-03-21 14:58:16 UTC | #184

This is the equivalent of –∞ state auction in a corrupt country. The difference is: auctions in corrupt countries (for road renovations for example) have multiple candidates and at least appear to be fair at first glance (on second - the winner is always predetermined). Here there's not even an illusion of fairness.

Why isn't there a chance for someone else to also propose a solution? Why is Toniq so special and why isn't there public discussion on how they got preferential treatment?

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-21 15:03:19 UTC | #185

Of course if you have a concrete good idea or action, I am all for it, and it seems that you already have some good ideas.
I think a DAO is something that anyone can take action on, and I think that would get us closest to the goal of decentralization.

That is not the point. This thread was created 3 weeks ago for the community to discuss. Jan didn't mention that Toniq is their first and only choice. We just had a few weeks of "discussions" and Jan comes in and states what Dfinity had planned all along as the way forwards. 

And I'm sure Toniq already have an ample head start for something probably no developer, outside of insiders, had an idea was being worked on (KYT).

Toniq was incubated in ICPMN, the same cartel that has majority of influence on the NNS and eco because DFINITY lent it.

So I assume this is finalised already?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-21 16:00:52 UTC | #190

My understanding is that these KYT providers will not accept ICP as payment from a DAO. They need a centralized entity to be the counterparty to pay in fiat for their KYT services. 

As a result, one or more entities need to contract with one or more KYT entities (Toniq -> Chainalysis being one example). 

The choice at this moment in time is wait until Dfinity creates a decentralized architecture for this or just roll it out now with Toniq and over the next couple months come up with a better decentralized architecture.

Given we are in the middle of a bear market and need to kickstart defi, I really don't see the massive downside in getting going and decentralizing in extremely short order.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 16:10:18 UTC | #191

Surely the bear market is a good reason to postpone since its not really going to get much use anyways? 

There hasnt been a single person who hasnt been shocked when I've put this in front of them and there's good reason why - It goes against all that ICP stands for and pretty much everything dfinity preaches day by day (not to mention Dominic is out there fighting other chains over their practices which puts ICP in a position of proving higher standards) 


If this is the direction we take, Ill be campaigning publically for awareness since this is how it usually goes: 

"Yeah well need to work on that"

"Yeah sorry we don't have the resources" 

"Oops we should have fixed this when we could" 


I don't know which BTC whale is willing to enter with all of the above mentioned issues 

Not to mention, this wasnt really discussed at all till now....

"Oh btw.... " <--- Seems a huge oversight? 

All in all, there is just so much obviously wrong with this - and needless to say, this will be reputation impacting

Tromix | 2023-03-21 16:34:27 UTC | #192

ckBTC is pooled, we can‚Äôt have different screening rules for eg users from region A vs users from region B, because user A may retrieve the bitcoin deposited by user B.
[/quote]

1) Steal $10 million BTC with a great hack
2) Convert immediately into ckBTC
3) Withdraw new BTC to new address
4) KYT labels stolen BTC as tainted
5) Laugh at ckBTC users with useless BTC

This is called "money laundering". I don't think it's what ICP or Dfinity want to be famous for.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-21 19:48:53 UTC | #194

Wait a minute? Did I miss the bidding stage for being a KYT provider? I'm really interested in having the power to hold the whole ckBTC ecosystem to ransom. Bills need paid! üòâ

Seriously though - we shouldn't be rushing into this. We only get one chance to make the right impression. If your loyal followers are picking ckBTC to bits then imagine what the rest of the crypto ecosystem would say. Justin Bons is warming up his keyboard for round 2 as we speak! 

Personally I trust the guys over at Toniq.. but it's a big ask for the whole crypto ecosystem to trust them. Yes they couldn't steal the BTC... but they could stop at any time, rate limit or just mess about. The don't even need to.. the fact that they 'COULD' is enough that no big money will trust ckBTC (IMHO).  

There is NO RUSH.. how many times did ETH devs kick ETH2 down the road. Let's get it right - we're still fighting the FUD from genesis. Let's not make something that we have to 'explain' for the next 2 years !

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-21 19:54:55 UTC | #195

I don't mind the oversight.. issues pop up which for whatever reason were not spotted. I do however have an issue with sticking a plaster on it and hoping for the best. What is the point of having the biggest and best team of cryptographers if we choose to implement a trust based system. Especially given how much Dom has been banging on about bridges on other chains.. You better believe they are lining up to pick ckBTC to bits! 

It's a tough issue to fix. I think we have to have some kind of KYT... otherwise ICP will become money laundering wet-dream. It sounds like Dfinity have already made their choice. I hope they listen to the community. We're on their side.. and we're not saying great things already!

That's great! I look forward to more people proposing to take this role. As Jan said, we hope to get to a place where we have multiple such providers instead of just one. Do you have any concrete entities that you think would be willing to participate?

The NNS does control the canisters. The NNS cannot directly have a subscription with a company like chainalysis. 

[quote="theguy, post:173, topic:18754"]
* What exactly is the impact if subscription runs out?

Then the ckBTC minter can be upgraded via an NNS proposal. You said above that you can essentially guarantee that others in the ecosystem would also be willing to run this service, so then this shouldn't be a problem.

* How long is the turnaround in case it runs out and we have to essentially DEFINE another KYT at that point, design and release?
[/quote]
For now, the KYT canister works with the chainalysis API. It's very easy to have another principal insert an API key, so if toniq goes away but someone else is willing to insert a chainalysis API key, it's a super simple proposal that can immediately be submitted. Hopefully in the near future there are canisters that can support other KYT APIs. 

[quote="theguy, post:173, topic:18754"]
1. What happens in the mean time to people who hold ckBTC or people who are reliant on services using ckBTC and need to mint?

If the ckBTC minter uses a KYT canister which has no API key, then no conversions can happen. But this is up to the NNS: anybody can propose eg to remove the KYT canister, or to change the principal that can insert API keys.

I think this may be a misunderstanding. Toniq's API key would be used for all ckBTC <> BTC conversions, this is not a toniq product. So i think it's only fair that they would get compensated per request.

Yeah I think something like that would be great. In my opinion, the approach with having a single KYT provider using a license provided by Toniq is just a starting point such that we can finally enable the BTC -> ckBTC conversion. It would be great to have more people provide API keys and for multiple different providers. Some concerns though: these subscriptions require upfront payment for a number of screenings, and the cost per screening is significantly higher if you buy a smaller amount of screenings. So there is a clear price overhead if many entities would buy small licenses. It would be much nicer if these companies were to offer on-chain services directly, but unfortunately that is not possible today.

We are saying when we launch, we are ok with a single point of failure and a dependancy in a third party (outside of the kyc provider) till hopefully more onboard - how we're yet to know, Toniq will just be implemented by default then a proposal to "handover" happens
