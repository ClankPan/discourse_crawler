Finally this is your DEFINING product opening the way to ckETH and other chains 

"it's ok it'll happen in time" when you have the power now - to, at minimum, reach out to other projects like iclighthouse, sonic, infinity swap

To not make this open for everyone and gate access for this "KYT onboarding"

Does dfinity really not see why there's an outflow from the development and user communities?

It all screams alternate agendas, it's obvious to see it's not the best way to approach your DEFINING features launch... It's already been 2 years, getting it right the first time is so important at this point.... 


Anyways, I get it. We've decided. This is how it is and you'll all have to swallow this pill, is the message right? There is no space to change this? 


Message received loud and clear.

I see where you’re coming from, but otoh, doesn’t it also make sense if more and more things are done by other entities than DFINITY? We should get out of a situation where people say ICP = DFINITY.
[/quote]

If Dfinity thinks this move will make people think ICP ≠ Dfinity, I hope this thread has them rethinking. Not only does it emphasise Dfinity's control of the IC, it shows a worrying lack of good sense. Absolutely everyone would be more comfortable with Dfinity handling the KYT subscription than handing it out with no discussion and no tender to another centralised organisation. Yes, there will be an NNS vote, but we know Dfinity / ICA will not and cannot be outvoted.
We have waited patiently while the project went over a year beyond its initially estimated timeline, and cheered the brilliant tech underpinning the whole thing. Dfinity had the community's firm backing in its effort to get it right and not rush.
And now this whole KYT issue which should have been flagged months ago is leading to rushed decisions nobody is comfortable with.

One thing that is getting overlooked is @bob11's post two weeks ago (https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754/24).  Toniq, on their own accord, put in a lot of time and effort to understand and solve the KYT solution, including retaining legal advice, seeking compliance council and receiving bids from KYT providers.  They obviously did this because they have a vested interest in ckBTC with their Ordinals plan.  The answer to "why Toniq is first" is simply they put in the work early on.  As discussed above, we all (DFINITY and the community) hope Toniq is not the only KYT for ckBTC.

We plan to put together a Twitter Space to discuss the issue, process and solution more.  If you are able to attend, would love to get you onstage to discuss with DFINITY R+D more.

This is just to not have to postpone opening up minting any longer. As Jan wrote in his post, if the first proposal passes, we plan to submit another one where we use KYT for ckBTC → BTC as well.

To go far, speed is less relevant and direction is more relevant. You can go fast but if you’re headed in the wrong direction then you won’t get to your destination. What I mean is… there is no point moving forward with a single point of failure in KYT having been signaled by other developers. Failure in such course is inevitable and there is strong dependency on the success of KYT canister.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-21 21:25:35 UTC | #208

All due respect to Bob and Toniq; they are obviously capable. But doesn’t DF have an active RFP process? I don’t recall seeing any request for KYT proposals on the forum. I admit I could have missed them though.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 21:27:49 UTC | #209

You put in the work so you get to go first?

The clear uproar from the community at minimum should state there are things wrong with this.

Internationalwaters | 2023-03-21 21:38:30 UTC | #210

Wouldn’t someone be able to launch a canister that lets you swap ckbtc w Icp without any of this none sense regardless of what devs do?

-------------------------

Kyle_Langham | 2023-03-21 21:48:46 UTC | #211

I'm not quite following... a RFP process is useful when there is a limited supply of contracts for service providers (ie, one contract to be bid on).  In this case there is unlimited supply of potential service providers (ie, anyone can become a KYT service provider).  How would a RFP work in this situation?

-------------------------

benji | 2023-03-21 21:55:42 UTC | #212

Sorry, I'm not understanding... due process for what?  It's a system that anyone can participate in, so I'm confused how due process or RFPs apply.  Not trying to be coy, but just interested in understanding the feedback.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-21 22:00:41 UTC | #214

I just reread the first 100 posts to make sure I wasn’t misremembering and from everything I’m seeing Toniq has been working closely with DF for the past few weeks to come up with a KYT solution. DF is also open to the idea of more providers in the future but believe that starting with a sole provider is the preferred option at this time. Toniq will now receive recurring compensation as the sole provider. There also seems to be a KYT canister that was developed at some point and that’s another effort that wasn’t made open for others to contribute.

This is just my current understanding of the events that led us here

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 22:04:53 UTC | #215

What is the public and the wider development community expected to read from this? 

This is OK is the message? As this isn't ok for any impartial entities to do

Due processes are in place to stop things like this in an average firm

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 22:06:29 UTC | #216

Not to mention, it's still bad design

That's really it

We're rushing it for entrepot to sell ordinals and we're putting out something that doesn't have to go out as it is, we can easily just work a month to onboarding a few more providers or at the LEAST just take it on internally in dfinity which would be far more comforting

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2023-03-21 23:02:25 UTC | #217

Why does Dfinity go through Toniq instead of contracting directly with a KYT provider? Is it because you envision multiple providers in the future and thought it would be better for Dfinity not to be involved?

Oh boy, I bet there's going to be a crap ton of rejections towards the upcoming proposals. Anyway, although I'm a bit skeptical as it seems like it's introducing a bit of centralization, it's ultimately still DeFi. Shall be voting to approve when it's all ready. :)

Yes, someone else can literally build another ckBTC ledger but everyone is waiting on Dfinity to act. I am in agree with most people wanting to do this KYT thing the right way but it's also very telling that there are no one willing to take the charge and build a ckBTC alternative with no KYT at all. It's very easy to complain but hard to build I guess. 

Also how about someone else get a chainalysis subscription or any other KYT providers and compete instead of waiting for Dfinity to initiate the whole thing? So far I have only seen theguy asking about how to actually solve the problem. I have reached to chainalysis find out more about the subscription and the price for it. If that's something individuals can do then I would be interested in providing such service and get compensated for it.

We know what the problem is. Let's be more solution-minded now.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-03-21 23:45:50 UTC | #222

The obvious solution is wait a bit and get the community involved. I am sure if there are incentives there will be many capable or organizations people to provide such service.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 23:49:37 UTC | #223

Think if dfinity is willing to postpone this, we can easily Reach out to Memecake, inf swap, genesis to see if they're interested as well as post out on twitter for builders to come forth 

This is given dfinity provides the docs and is willing to work on this to release a full and secure product

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-21 23:51:05 UTC | #224

Incentives are, the subscription hosters would get paid per call made to their subscription service which is enough to motivate people, especially at this point

We are all fully aware of the centralised nature of NNS so in reality all we have is this forum

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-21 23:56:08 UTC | #227

I have submitted a request to Chainalysis today - however need to see what kind of costs there are for the API access. Unlike Toniq, 221Bravo/ Genesis II doesn't have any reason beyond ckBTC to pay for the API access (at the moment). The question then centres around KYT fees and if this would come close to covering the costs. I don't mind being slightly out of pocket for the greater good of ICP.. however my overall budget/ available funding for building on the IC is modest.

-------------------------

Internationalwaters | 2023-03-22 00:11:23 UTC | #228

My guess is that financial distribution is the main cause why there isn’t any competitor to dfinity. So the decision that dfinity makes has lasting impact. It might take 2 to 6 years for anyone to enter the market to compete with the KYT decision if it is implemented. That is because it is not easy to find talent and fuel canisters to work with demand as needed by the market. Now if dfinity released ckBtc without KYT, then Tonic can enter the market and charge developers who want to use KYT. This would distinguish KYT from the dfinity developed ckBtc and NNS canisters. That will be a win win for everyone. The community would be free from a centralized entity, and the US would enforce KYT as the option would have been made available for developers in their country.

As we navigate as a community through such challenging situations, decentralization remains the number one priority. Moving forward the vision is to have multiple KYT providers and API key holders as well as multiple ckBTC variants, including non-KYT canisters controlled by the NNS. While the ckBTC canister is currently controlled by the NNS, this could change in the future, e.g., to be controlled by an SNS. However, that will require a thorough design and take time to implement. For now, control by the NNS is the most secure and also fastest way to move forward.

Why am I not surprised to see so many people who apparently didn't read the full message by @Jan.  The ckBTC KYT solution proposed by DFINITY is solid and the service offered by toniq is fair.  Let's move forward and get this ckBTC thing launched.  If anyone wants more KYT providers or API key holders, then do it!  If anyone wants a non KYT version of ckBTC, then do it!  For now, I would like to see the version proposed by @Jan move forward.

Toniq is the first to take the risk, make the commitment, develop the expertise, address the legal issues, and help solve the problem.  They earned the right to be the first on the list.  There is nothing stopping others from doing it too.

What do you know about toniq. Are they a named neuron? How much funding do they have? What are their ethos? Can they manage the threshold of the market? What about their real time analysis of tainted BTC? Have they been tested? This is all information I believe needs answers before blindly accepting to have a working relationship with the larger community. 
And it’s not anyone can do what toniq has done. It’s, people with funds can be in a position to do what toniq has done.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 03:03:48 UTC | #236

Not here to answer everything, just wanted to provide a bit of context.

1. From the many legal and compliance conversations I have had, KYT is absolutely mandatory for any company that uses a token like ckBTC and allows US citizens to interact on their platform. So either you block US citizens from using your platform or you use KYT (not legal advice).
2. Toniq is not making money on being a KYT provider. ckBTC fees will be paid to Toniq, but these fees all go to covering costs and that is it. No profit, so hard to see why anyone would want to be a KYT provider.
3. Being a KYT provider is more of a burden than anything else. There is nothing glamorous about this.
4. It is very likely Toniq will lose money as a KYT provider. You have to sign a yearly contract (all KYT providers I've spoken to do yearly contracts) and you have to pay for the full year upfront. Then you hope to have enough volume to cover the upfront costs. Even with high volume, Toniq won't make money, fees just go down a little bit to wrap.
5. Decentralized KYT doesn't exist right now. You have to have a centralized entity that manages the KYT process. That entity could be Dfinity, a VC firm, a KYT provider itself, or a business entity. Regardless of who you pick, you still have a point of centralization. I think the goal is to have many different providers that can play this role (maybe even do a 2/3 consensus model) but costs are a concern here as KYT is fairly expensive.
6. The KYT provider in the proposed model has a VERY limited scope. The only abilities granted to this KYT provider are (1) add API key to KYT canister, and (2) withdraw funds from fees. No code changes. No canister control. No ability to tamper with anything.
7. The risk associated with having a single KYT provider are very low. The only thing a KYT provider could do is turn off their API key. In this case, the ckBTC minter would stop working (because no KYT). In this case, Dfinity (or anyone) would initiate a proposal to the NNS, and we would whitelist a new KYT principal to add a new API key. Once the new API key is in, everything resumes as normal. No funds lost. Nothing broken. Just a few hours of delay. Because of this low risk, I'm in favor of enabling ckBTC now (with a single KYT provider) and decentralizing the KYT process with additional providers over time as others are willing to assume the additional risk and responsibility of being a KYT provider.

I know I haven't addressed all points, but hopefully this provides some missing context around KYT.

-------------------------

bitbruce | 2023-03-22 03:04:34 UTC | #237

I see that you have decided to implement the KYT program, so I will not raise any further objections.

But we need to address the issues that we face. These problems stem from the fact that blockchain data is deterministic and off-chain KYT data is non-deterministic (and sometimes subjectively biased).

Let me describe the problem.
1. User A adds BTC (this time its utxo passes the KYT check), gets ckBTC and spends it. After two days, this utxo is marked as tainted by KYT, so what happens then? How to make sure the non-contaminated BTC:ckBTC = 1:1?
2. If multiple KYT providers are used, what should be done when one provider considers a utxo to be contaminated and another considers it to be uncontaminated?

[/quote]

@bob11 Great points! The information you provided is helpful in understanding the nature and business structure of KYT. 

However I think toniq needs its own SPOKESPERSON  to answer questions like where is the company registered? Is it a non profit company? Are they subsidized by a government?  How many employees does the company have. Do they have a website? What is their budget? Do they have enough talent for emergency cases?

Switching off an API just to restart it is detrimental to business. What if someone had a position in a stock market that they have to close. Time is of essence in such a situation and for them to even think about using ckBtc in such a manner, they have to know how quick a matter might be solved. Or what if someone is paying employees with the ckBtc mechanism. Employees don’t care about what happened and they can’t go long without quitting. So an employer would need clarity on the confidence of the system. Again these are just worst case scenarios imagined that would probably not occur but if they do can be of catastrophic magnitude. 

When you listen to Dom marketing the IC, you can tell he understands the market and his ideas are well put and you can tell he took time overseeing a great product being made. As a result of him taking time he knew how to deliver the message hence developers who joined the IC had none of those questions in their mind. They automatically knew where the company was located, what branches it had, how long they had been in business, the R&D, the numbers of employees and many more. Now that the tide is going towards toniq side I think they aught to speak more to clarify on some of these concerns. Also it would be nice to know what Dom thinks of the KYT canister. 

There is no need to rush as there is no other companies developing ckbtc. There needs to be more time allocated for the dfinity team and the community at large to discuss this issues more. Or if dfinity has already made their decision they need more time to see if they feel the same way about the decision they made. There have been numerous stages of IC development that have been postponed and this ckBtc won’t be the first one.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 03:45:18 UTC | #239

Interesting. Why am I not surprised. I’d like to take a moment to actually thank Bob and Toniq for performing what is essentially a public service to the IC community. 

As a result of Toniq doing this service at a cost to them, ckBTC can be kickstarted. Toniq can launch their ordinal marketplace, and all the other defi apps can utilize ckBTC. 

So yeah, thanks Bob. Hopefully others will step up too as we decentralize this. I would like you and other folks to actually get paid for this service in the future as you are doing work, incurring costs, and providing a benefit to the entire IC ecosystem. 

For now I appreciate you doing this for no margin and at a cost to yourself. The future designs need to be different to be sustainable.

To be fair not all money is good money. If someone if incurring costs they aught to explain how they got that money. Because they are not just throwing or handing out money. 

Is the money being spent on KYT canister an investment of toniq; if so who are the investors. 

Or is it someone doing goodwill work ?

I think we now know why nobody else is doing it or will do it. I might want more KYT providers but that doesn't mean I am willing to take the effort to become one when it is a money losing or at best break-even proposition.

I think it's great that we have someone up and ready to be a KYT provider *provided* KYT is from the start an optional service, an extra step investors can choose to take, rather than something baked into the design of ckBTC. If there was no connection between KYT provision and the NNS, absolutely nobody would object to Toniq being a KYT provider, and maybe a model could develop where Toniq can make a profit with a little extra tacked on to ckBTC fees for their service.

I work with traders daily, these aren't an "Oh well another time" type situation!

Also what is the cost? And what %fees will Toniq get per transaction? Is this not going to be transparent?

I think anyone can become a KYT propagator like Toniq, or create a ckBTC canister without KYT. I would support such an action. It is easy to cry centralization for actions we don't agree with, but if someone doesn't take action, there will be a long way to decentralization.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 05:30:57 UTC | #244

Yeah i mean the action dfinity first needs to do is put out the costs + make the knowledge available, make people AWARE that KYT canister has been in the works all this time, maybe being up that there'll be a single provider more than 5 days before the final release....

It's not like anyone had the luxury of going - ok I won't be a KYT provider


Also the fees and costs are very much not revealed

We just need to trust rn it's fine.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 05:44:04 UTC | #245

This.

Neither this design structure nor Toniq Reasoning nor Dfinitys reasoning makes sense 

Yesterday, dfinity AND Kyle, our local astrologers deal was "they get to go first cause they deserve it"

Today we're told there's no money in it but no idea of costs or fees and Toniq is still a business


"it's ok if KYT goes down, not a big deal" when there are many scenarios where it is and it's not a decision to be made by Bob...

Any service, especially your crowning achievement, requires resilience? 

All just mad to me

FOX | 2023-03-22 05:47:44 UTC | #246

There are a number of prominent opinions that raise the issue of tonic's profitability (over and above the issue of single points of failure), but I personally don't see a problem with it. I think it's great that there are users who decide that it's good for business and join a provider, and I think that the creation of such followers from the community will be a solid tolerance to keep CKBTC going for a long time.

(ICP is waiting for support from good CO founders)

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 05:49:04 UTC | #247

That’s a very reasonable ask. I agree. Dfinity should make the costs transparent so folks can verify. 

Toniq is incentivized to do this so it can launch its ordinals marketplace. It’s decided to bear the cost to benefit everyone so they can beat OpenSea or whoever else is out there in the non IC ecosystem that’s working on ordinals. It’s not charity, but it’s also a benefit we all get. It would be like a whale deciding to spend personal money on marketing to lift the price of ICP. 

I’m not sure what you mean by “they get to go first”. Toniq is not uniquely benefitting from this. I’m sure they would prefer someone else to cough up.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 05:49:15 UTC | #248

Well it's only raised because we're told it's not profitable and yesterday told "they get to be first because of their hard work"

What is the costs and what fees do they get?

I’m not sure what you mean by “they get to go first”. Toniq is not uniquely benefitting from this. I’m sure they would prefer someone else to cough up.
[/quote]

Yeah don't ask me, these are Kyle's words

Also the whole web 3 ideology is, verify, don't trust - so I'd like this model.made transparent as I have no reason to trust a single entity

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 05:55:28 UTC | #250

I feel like the root cause of the angst against Toniq is the fear that Dfinity is showing favoritism by enabling a single entity to benefit from being a KYT provider. 

Bob has told us this is not true. Dfinity has told us this is not true. I believe them both. So let’s just ask Dfinity to provide a way for folks to verify that fact. 

In the future, as I mentioned I actually think folks NEED to benefit from performing KYT otherwise no one will do it (or they’ll hold their breath and hope someone else does it).

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 05:59:55 UTC | #251

The root cause is, dfinity is releasing ckBTC, the thing that's supposed to eliminate 3rd party dependancy

And starting off by just giving it to a third party whom everyone needs to trust to ensure minting is up - is insane

Bad design - is insane 

Also "I trust them cause they said" <-- this in itself is insane, all of this can be verified and always should be verified, the whole idea of decentralised cloud is to remove single points of failure and we're adding one to BTC, an investment vehicle 

^ none of that is unreasonable and they're real problems with how this is done and not "I think" 

We can't dismiss this as "yeah people just don't want to see favouritism" since there's been no due process and a lot was done behind the scenes.

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-22 06:14:41 UTC | #252

I understand your frustration with leaving it to Toniq and I'm sure there are other ideas.
I suppose someone could name another provider or build a canister without KYT (I believe the foundation responded that way if I am not mistaken).
Such actions lead to decentralization and anyone can act like that in Web3.
The single point of failure would be the current situation where there is no one but Toniq to take such actions.

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2023-03-26 12:51:09 UTC | #253

In case anyone is wondering why this guy is kissing ass here, it’s because he’s the “manager” of ICPMN Neurons



@Manu have you heard of “Credible Neutrality”?



Do they not teach ethics with cryptography?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 06:21:14 UTC | #254

I would disagree that in order to ship ckBTC it first needs to be perfect. If the IC had to be perfect before it launched, it actually would still be in R&D stages and still wouldn’t have launched. For example, the boundary nodes are still controlled by Dfinity and many aspects of decentralization are still in process. 

I would say don’t let perfection be the enemy of good enough. I prefer speed at this moment in time provided security of funds is not compromised. 

A valid question is what’s the worst that can happen under the current design? I think the worst case scenario is that Toniq prevents minting additional ckBTC and then the NNS revokes its minting ability. 

I’m honestly really not too sure what you are so worried about. Soon the big brains at Dfinity will develop a more decentralized design. 

With regard to trust, I already said I agree with you. We shouldn’t have to trust Toniq isn’t making money here and Dfinity should make that all transparent.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:22:47 UTC | #255

No we assume that

No one really knows this is even a possibility

Genesis literally mentioned before he's interested and none of the other builders even know about this 

Let's not evangalize Toniq for doing something no one was even made aware of.

That would be the first step - delay, transparency and awareness to bring forward anyone else who might be interested

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:27:17 UTC | #256

I don't see how basic resilience is "Perfect"

We literally just need to add a few more providers or atleast make dfinity the main provider for optics since dfinity has to be trusted anyways 

There should be no real work in asking a few more people to see if they're interested in being a KYT subscriber and add them 


It's not exactly perfection David... It's a basic necessity for good tech and to be frank I don't see why we even need all this back and forth to do something so basic 

-Delay
-reach out to the community

I can even help gather the interested parties if dfinity just shares the cost and the earnings

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:29:02 UTC | #257

Also let's assume Toniq really isn't making money


Then this model is flawed, we would always be dependant in Toniq since no one will want to onboard? 

Man... The issues just keep popping up, who designed this KYT, it's amess

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-22 06:32:39 UTC | #258

You are free to wait for a detailed response from Toniq. But is this "validation" necessary to take action? I think it is possible for some CO Founder, for example, whether for charity or business, to claim to be a transparent KYT provider instead of a centralized Toniq.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:34:34 UTC | #259

I don't know what this means. There is 0 information to take action if anyone wanted to.

I'm personally taking action though, on the community awareness front since dfinity decided to do it all under Wraps

https://twitter.com/OgMedalist/status/1638428240929865728?t=ztbVfDPFPLdkMkzLFLxzqQ&s=19

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-22 06:37:12 UTC | #260


Either way I think the current response is the best we can do at this time to move forward with implementation. I don't think ridiculing it as centralized without contributing to decentralization is an alternative, but the only other alternative at this point would be to leave the CKBTC functionality blank until the Good founders come up with the perfect idea.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 06:37:35 UTC | #261

Before you rush to social media, you’ve made some valid points on a lack of transparency and I think it’s only fair to give Dfinity 24-48 hours to respond. They’re not on the forums and on social media 24/7 as they actually have to build the thing!

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:38:34 UTC | #262

As I keep saying, the alternatives have been already mentioned

-Delay it

-Speak to interested parties

-fix the fee payment model 

-be transparent about the model


What don't you understand about these tangible actions we can do right now?

-------------------------

esquivada | 2023-03-22 06:39:39 UTC | #263

Why is speed in a bear market so important for Dfinity? I understand that it is for Tonic. I think that Dfinity as a leader should, as it usually does, have included the community in the solution to this problem.

Simply promoting a sustainable and decentralized mechanism where more KYT providers can participate in a way that is done with node providers. The way in which Dfinity has decided by the finger who will be the provider of KYT has not been liked by the community.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:41:29 UTC | #264

I was supposed to do this space anyways - I was requested by the wider community to host this today 

But I think this awareness will be good for community and Dfinity

Currently I'm getting multiple different views from both Dfinity and Toniq on profitablily and frankly the responses basically amount to "it's fine" from yesterday

Not even sure which authority figure we're waiting to come on here and make decisions

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-03-22 06:42:55 UTC | #265

Because we are currently number 40 on CoinMarketCap and we should be number 3. Our technology is far superior to literally anything else but we had an unfortunate launch and it is just taking forever to ship product. We’ve been talking SNS for over a year and it just shipped recently. The longer it takes us to ship product the less relevant we become. Security must never be compromised. But other than that we need to get a move on.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:43:05 UTC | #266

They want to "catch the ordinal craze", which from what I can see is not really a craze

Eden marketplace is live with Ordinals and you can probably see there how it's going 

ckBTC is so much bigger than Toniq and it really pains me to be reduced to a central entity

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:44:32 UTC | #267

Right and the way to do this is sustainable building

At my work place we would never allow this release to go through

I've spent many a call doing exactly what I'm doing now and I expect better from dfinity, especially considering Dominic out there attacking other chains for doing things like this

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-22 06:45:43 UTC | #268

I don't think there is any problem to continue the conversation, so please do as you wish. It would be best if both parties could present the best fee model and method of transparency. I have high hopes for the Foundation and Tonique Shinjuku.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:45:45 UTC | #269

Everyone is WAITING to pick apart ckBTC

We've spent 2 years praising it as the holy grail of BTC, so why were giving ammunition to other chains to tear us down, I don't know

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:48:17 UTC | #270

Same, we've bet in this chain. What we do is only possible on ICP, and how we go about these very important decisions and changes is not how it should be done 

It's simply a matter of setting up processes and following them 

"you want to do X, we have to follow Y" - else an org falls in on itself 

To me it's clear dfinity struggles to manage itself as an org and disparities and communication issues are rife 

And it starts with here and these changes, and how we address them

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 06:58:20 UTC | #271

Just as a Side note on the favouritism part 

Imagine where we could be if we went with: 

"Lets have a word with other Defi projects in the eco, see what they think, lets ask Infinityswap, Sonic and ICLighthouse" 

^Imagine the kind of community spirit and cohesion we could add with a small change in approach

Money isn't the main driver that keeps communities together, especially in bear, but to feel part of something bigger would not only benefit this eco, it would also have multiple points of view raising these concerns before it gets to this point 

Its not even the first time Dfinity has been accused of this and all it takes is a simple, costless change in the ways of working

I understand your point. I'm not an expert, but I think that the narrative on web 3 is important, and it must be more coherent when it comes to a decentralized global computer as a worldwide alternative to centralization, a point for which Dom has been struggling. I think Dfinity could have handled this in a smarter way.
Something as simple as, we have this problem, we are working on a decentralized and sustainable solution to incorporate different KYT suppliers, this will be a little more time than expected, we believe that now there is an opportunity to position ourselves in the market if we launch ckBTC, the immediate and temporary solution is not decentralized to this problem, but we think it's worth it, the immediate solution would be this, bla bla  bla etc We will make a proposal to see what the community thinks, the people are always sovereign Etc etc Communication on web3 is everything.
To achieve success  in the coming world, it is necessary to have good communication and incorporate the community in decision-making, since the community is the most valuable resource, being able to be the best marketing army that anyone can have.

I know that Dfinity is aware of this, that's why I think they can and should improve in decision-making.
At the technical and operational level, would it make sense in the new incorporation of node suppliers to add the requirement to also provide KYT taking advantage of the decentralized and secure mechanism being independent parties that for nodes located in North America would also become KYT providers?

-------------------------

CatPirate | 2023-03-22 07:03:05 UTC | #273

Bro. They have a comms department to keep track of the comms. If you think DFINITY isn’t upto date with the news of its own ecosystem then you’re coping.

MagicEden on Solana released their BTC Marketplace already for Ordinals 

Their top volume is 126392.83$

Their second highest volume is 10179.29$

This is the volume thats making us rush? 

MagicEden has more volume in 1 day than the top ICP collection does in its lifetime

Just some perspective

![image|690x189](upload://xTMIx7QfLVSw4Pchgh4loaNTHja.png)

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 08:44:58 UTC | #276

The design eliminates 3rd party dependency. It can accomodate one or many KYT providers. So it is not a centralized design.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 08:47:11 UTC | #277

This has been addressed above. 

Why arent we accommodating multiple at the start? No reason not to? 

Dfinity claims there is sufficient monetisation to encourage KYT Subscription providers to come forward 

meanwhile Toniq claims they will be making a loss <-- Hence no incentive for multiple KYT providers, so which is it? 

What are the numbers and why is it not transparent? 

^All to be addressed

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 08:49:50 UTC | #278

They have made a proposal to start with one. Now it either passes or fails the vote.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2023-03-22 08:50:20 UTC | #279

If there is no incentive to incorporate new suppliers, it will be an insecure and centralized system

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 08:50:25 UTC | #280

The whole point is, they havent.

There is no proposal to "Accept Toniq as a KYT Subscription provider" and there is no docs nor details for anyone else to even attempt to try being a subscription provider.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 08:52:38 UTC | #281

The proposal to switch it on has information that Toniq provides query access to Chainanalysis. So you vote Yes or No with that fact in mind.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 08:55:12 UTC | #282

Thats the whole point of this forum, is to discuss these details to come to whats an appropriate proposal to make. Else this place need not exist. 

Also literally anything can be in the proposal, and the proposal thats planned to my knowledge is "Onboard KYT canister" 

not "Onboard Toniq as subscriber" 

You are not only assuming a LOT but also the inexperience on how tech resiliency works shows.

(Source: 10 years of working in financial technology with ample experience in resilience and risk management)

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 08:59:02 UTC | #283

The forum exists for consultation.  If I dont feel like consulting and i have made up my mind on how I think my proposal should be, I can also just upload it to the community for voting. It shouldnt be a requirement for submitting a proposal that I must consult on everything.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:00:46 UTC | #284

Right so this is Dfinity's process not yours and you don't define what this forum is used for 

Feel free to submit a proposal though, nothing stops you

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:02:25 UTC | #285

DFinity is a contributor like any other. It should be able to do what it deems best without undue armtwisting and blackmail.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:04:50 UTC | #286

Right, and it IS doing what it wants to 

This is literally defined by Dfinity 

and what you call arm twisting and blackmail, is literally exposure of what's being talked about here 

All of it is TRUE, are you saying it should be hidden and within walls where people are not aware? 

Transparency is key to honest business.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:05:49 UTC | #287

The proposal is transparent. Now it will be put to a vote.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:06:26 UTC | #288

There is no proposal. 

Also its not transparent, hence the request for the information.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:07:47 UTC | #289

The proposal will come. Then we will vote Yes or No.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:08:58 UTC | #290

Right and here we're still in the process of discussing whether current way of doing this is the best before the proposal 

Theres still a lot of stones unturned and we're in the middle of doing this

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:12:53 UTC | #291

I prefer a process where we do not censor proposals based on the fact that someone is still thinking, or still not aligned. We should let proposals be uploaded, then we vote. What we will become will be the sum total of the ideal and the non ideal things that we pass. But that will be us. We are not a web2 corporate that has to align upwards before passing decisions.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:15:31 UTC | #292

This is EXACTLY why Dfinity has this process in place - to get community involvement 

You are free to work with them to change this process if you feel its unbecoming of web 3

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:19:03 UTC | #293

Which part of the process do you believe should change? I think it is okay that they have refined their thoughts on how ckBTC should be designed, consulted on some aspects, probablt decided on their own on some other aspects. Final gate will be a vote by the community.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:21:09 UTC | #294

They, out of the blue, dropped that Toniq will be the sole subscription provider for ckBTC and if this subscription isnt available, then no minting of ckBTC can happen. 

No one knew about this till yesterday. 

Today Im making everyone aware this is the current model <-- Which  I would assume is important for the vote (Though its pointless since Dfinity can override anyones vote by themselves alone, just like AWS i.e. Web 2)

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:23:50 UTC | #295

Not to mention the reason for rushing this is so we can "Join in the Ordinal craze" and sell ordinals

meanwhile, there is like no money in ordinals on a marketplace many many many times the size of us

![image|690x185](upload://qQmWbBj2TqDe1zJbDhwODeG3eBv.png)

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:34:17 UTC | #296

Every proposal is okay. If I think that ordinals are important I will rush to submit a proposal, or make last minute changes, then you vote no if you think different. If I believe that I should go live with ckBTC with Toniq providing Chainanalysis, I could let you see that in the proposal, then you vote Yes or No. DFinity will use its own vote, and the vote of the community that trusts and delegates to it.
A proposal can be of any shape or form that the proposer decides it to be, then the community decides. There should be no centralised gate keepers in the forum bullying and armrwisting to see their kind of process followed. We should all wait for the vote, or make our own counter-proposals.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:35:53 UTC | #297

Right and we are still in the forum of discussion and this is important enough to create public awareness 

Again if its TRUE how us it bullying or armtwisting? 

Its. All. True. 

if its not a problem, then its all fine right? 

if its a problem, people will be aware to raise it as an issue 

everyone wins.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 09:37:19 UTC | #298

There is only one truth. That there is/will be a proposal, and that it will be put to a vote. Everything else is subjective.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 09:38:01 UTC | #299

Right so thats the reason for discussion, just like when there are elections, there are debates

This isnt new, thats all thats happening.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-22 10:15:24 UTC | #300

Hi Bob! 

Thank you for your detailed post. I think it's great that you've put Toniq forward for doing this and I understand why you want ckBTC shipped really fast. 

From what you've said it sounds like there is no financial reason to be a KYT provider which means that there is unlikely to be anyone else who goes for it. I've got a meeting with Chainalysis at 11.30 but I imagine they will tell me the price and that will be a no-go for us. 

What happens if Toniq gets bought out? OpenSea, or some VC firm comes in and give you crazy money for your project.. what then? They might not have the same view as yourself and could just switch off the service?  

What if Bob and Steve want to live like bond villains and use KYT services as a weapon. (Like Putin and nordstream).. I know these are unlikely scenarios but we should design core services to cover these events.

Also what is the setup of the KYT. Does the KYT canister call chainalaysis directly using your API key or does the call go to a Toniq server as a middle man? If there is a middle server then that creates another point of failure which should be discussed.  

If there has to be a single entity.. then why is that not Dfinity? I imagine there has to be a legal/ political reason for this? If so.. let's hear it. 

If the mega-minds have considered all the options then I'm happy to go with this decision.. but from a community perspective it seems like there has been a  lot of 'closed door' discussions and decisions made which makes this forum post a bit pointless.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-22 10:25:05 UTC | #301

Further to this... there is also the Internet Computer Association. Could they not get a API key if Dfinity want to remain 'at a distance?'

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 10:31:08 UTC | #302

It is damaging if is done sensationally (the political way). See post below by NS01 that takes a more inquisitive format to clarify concerns rather than chasing clout points.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-22 11:08:40 UTC | #303

IIRC the ICA is not what it was intended to be; a separate entity comprised of node providers and other contributors that is distinct from the foundation in its management and operation.

I believe Dom acknowledged they ran into obstacles trying to get it started so it’s currently under the same management as DF. I could be wrong though. I’ll try to find that post in a bit.

Edit: This is Dom's response from: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/what-is-the-internet-computer-association/15969/50?u=lightninglad91

> For the record. The ICA is meant to be a members organization, but there are two challenges that have put its development on the back burner: (1) there are far more important things for the team to be working on right now, (2) we could not transfer legal ownership of ICP to the ICA for tax reasons; essentially that it would involve a gift, and in Zürich, where DFINITY is based, a substantial gift tax would be involved. So for now it controls voting neurons for security purposes (distribution of keys etc) and that’s it. We have ideas about how to fix this, and develop the organization, but it’s going to be a major undertaking, and we don’t have the bandwidth right now. Period.
