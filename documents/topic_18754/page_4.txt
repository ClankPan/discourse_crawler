I get the sense there is a lot of pressure from all directions to deliver something and times not really on Dfinitys side...

-------------------------

elwynnforest | 2023-03-23 17:25:20 UTC | #407

Feel the same. I'm surprised that the DFINITY team didn't consider this whole issue of tainted BTC **one year ago** when they so cheerfully churned out demo after demo claiming the feature would land next month, as if they're just noobs wondering into the wonderful world of crypto. 

Maybe they are.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-23 17:25:36 UTC | #408

yeah agreed. Again im not trying to get in the way of that. I just thought, based on Stephen and Bob's response, that there might be an opportunity to fork this effort and wanted to show my support for that option if it really was available.

If not then I fall back to my previous statement about ship it now and fix later.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 17:27:24 UTC | #409

Yeah I think you're right - if we have option, it might be a good idea to do exactly this

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 17:36:37 UTC | #410

While I don't want to be too harsh, this is definitely something to take back for @Jan on the design process 

Starting with the picture as a whole so everyones aware of all the components that need to be built 

Perhaps this was done but we were only fed piece meal and KYT is being pushed faster under pressure 

if its the latter, its good to engage the community from the get go on all things needed for a feature, like a "High level design plan"

It would give dfinity a lot of support in many ways from the get go

[quote="skilesare, post:374, topic:18754"]
As mentioned before though…there WILL be a lag and eventually flagged BYC will almost assuredly get into the utxo pool. I think we need to look at the architecture to figure out how to deal with those. That seems like a much bigger problem.

Seems like the canister needs a utxo queue where we’d be able to push flagged utxos to the back of the queue in such a way that they would likely never come out. If one does make it in then likely fees should increase until the amount is burned. Or everyone is slashed…this would make diligent enforcement a network priority.

[quote="Jonathan, post:352, topic:18754"]
Given that ckBTC is liquid and will naturally be lost over time in an open system, what happens to the BTC that accumulates in the canister as a result?
[/quote]

[quote="bob11, post:353, topic:18754"]
This is a great question. Likely locked in the protocol forever in its current implementation due to the exact 1:1 nature of BTC <> ckBTC.
[/quote]

It seems like we are approaching a solution to this issue. If perpetually lost ckBTC > tainted BTC in canister, the tainted BTC basically gets blackholed. This isn't really a problem as the only other option is for perfectly good BTC to get blackholed.

So long as lost ckBTC > tainted BTC, a "mostly accurate" KYT solution can maintain the 1:1 ratio not only numerically, but *in value*.

Of course, this is a matter of actuarial science since these are variables we cannot specifically know. But this same principle works for insurance companies, and it is the only solution I can see that can solve the problem while working within the current system.

Dfinity will read the reservations, objections, and then make up its mind on what it thinks is the right path forward.  

I hope for the sake of us all it decides to just move forward. I do not think its a good idea to fragment liquidity between wBTC and ckBTC when we are already so behind relative to other chains on defi. BUT - ultimately it is not up to me. It is up to the NNS. And as a participant in ICP I have signed up to this governance structure whereby I must accept what the NNS tells me. Dfinity has a lot of sway over the NNS, so I expect it to pass. If you don't like that, I suggest you find a different blockchain because that is not going to change anytime soon. 

Also, as an aside, as ICP gets more popular, these forums will start to get completely untenable. I do think there is a limit to on-chain governance where every single post can be responded to. Imagine in the future thousands, or tens of thousands of people, providing their opinion on this or that. It could be a full time job just trying to read it all. We are already at 408 posts where many of the posts are incredibly repetitive. If OpenChat has billions of users, image 100,000 people posting in the OpenChat forum and expecting Hamish to get back to everyone. Its just not going to work.

In such a situation you just ask an algorithm to pick the top most concerning issues that are being talked about and need immediate action. Every problem has a solution. What’s important is that everyone’s voice should be heard.

To repeat: our intent is to deliver a first version of ckBTC, with reasonable trade-offs, so that the real iterative process of ckBTC can begin. There is no security shortcut being taken. There will be MANY iterations and improvements from learnings from ckBTC being used. We see a future where there are multiple KYT providers offering services on ICP. But that won’t be built quickly, as it requires KYT providers to cooperate and to do some implementation work on their end.

TLDR;

* On-chain KYT will be an important piece for future DeFi
* Want to finish first version of ckBTC that address community concern and then iterate
* We are working towards having multiple on-chain KYT providers
* Ongoing discussions with various KYT providers (e.g. Elliptic, TRM, Crystal Blockchain, Merkle Science) are ongoing to establish direct interaction with ICP without an intermediary.

Feedback

First of all, I want to highlight that for as active as this thread is, DFINITY’s intent is exactly what has happened (apart from that I should have been clearer in my previous post): get feedback on what DFINITY is planning. We at DFINITY do not see this as a bug, but rather a feature of the system/community. There are many, many plans DFINITY has which have iterated and gone through revision.

My only ask is that folks remember:

* Please keep it civil
* We all want ICP to win. DFINITY is actively looking for best arguments and rationale to improve any plans. We have no problem iterating on anything.
* Perfect can be the enemy of the good. It is reasonable not everyone would make the same trade-offs, but let’s acknowledge or respect that.
* ckBTC is just one smart contract on the application layer. There could be many with many different rules. It is unlikely that there can be a smart contract that satisfies everyone’s intent and needs, but that’s ok!

Decentralized KYT

As things in the background were still evolving, I may not have been clear enough on our approach to KYT providers in my previous posts, so please allow me to further clarify. The general idea is that there will be a number of different KYT providers in addition to Chainanalysis. Ideally, all entities providing KYT services on the market would offer their services also directly on the Internet Computer via their own canister. DFINITY has been intensively talking to various KYT service providers, including Elliptic, TRM, Crystal Blockchain, Merkle Science, to make this happen and we are making good progress on this front.

The main issue we’ve encountered is that KYT providers are currently not set up to do this, meaning: 1) they cannot push API keys to a canister and 2) cannot receive ckBTC, ICP or cycles as payment for their services. There is no telling how long it would take to get them to this point, which is why we’ve opted for an immediate solution with Chainanalysis to be able to release ckBTC sooner rather than later.

As the regulatory landscape is changing, so are KTY requirements. Offering KYT services directly on the Internet Computer will become an important enabler for DeFI on the Internet Computer. We envision that such services can be paid for in cycles, just like other services. Indeed, KYT will become a much broader issue than just ensuring that bitcoin that is transacted via ckBTC is sellable on centralized exchanges. Whether or not one likes the change of the regulatory landscape, as a community we need to ensure that we are able to address such challenges and provide the necessary building blocks for DeFI on the Internet Computer to flourish.

Why KYT for ckBTC?

Some of you have been asking why bother with KYT services in the first place? DFINITY and other members of the ICP ecosystem have been strongly advised by legal counsel of the following:

1. KYT will minimize the risk to users of ckBTC
2. Deploying a version of ckBTC without KYT puts DFINITY at risk, even if the ckBTC canister is controlled by the NNS.

Why Toniq?

As mentioned, KYT providers are currently not technically equipped to directly interact with blockchains, so we have reached out to the ICP community for help to launch ckBTC with KTY possible and to act as an intermediary party between KYT providers and the Internet Computer. A few came forward and were supportive, and Bob Bodily & Toniq were particularly eager to participate in a solution and move quickly due to their interest in BTC Ordinals. If other parties want to offer similar help, please contact me. The community’s eagerness to help contribute in cases like this one is greatly appreciated!

As outlined above, we want to move towards a solution where there will be a market for KYT services on the Internet Computer and where KYT providers can make money with their services. For this to happen, we will need substantial volume and a flourishing DeFi ecosystem. Also, there will very likely be additional services around KYT that providers could offer including risk mitigation and additional forms of screening that users could do prior to initiating a transaction.

I hope I’ve managed to bring more clarity to the situation. Again, the first steps that are being taken, are obviously not the perfect solution and were never meant to be the final step. It is just a way to immediately bring ckBTC to its full functionality. I can’t stress enough that this is an ongoing journey, and that all ckBTC solutions are possible, and everyone in the community is welcome to become KYT API key holders or implement their other KYT processes using other KYT providers.

How to become a KYT API key provider for Chainanalysis KYT

We do take the concerns you all raised seriously and are currently working on a mechanism so that any party can add an API key to ensure that KYT via Chainanalysis does not depend on a single API key provider (i.e., Toniq). Naturally, the mechanism still depends on Chainanalysis. However, this is their core business.

Nevertheless, as said above, we are also working on extending the set of KYT providers.

Controller of ckBTC

There have been some discussions about the controller of ckBTC. Some options that have been mentioned are

* No controller (blackhole)
* A “multisig” setup
* An SNS
* The NNS

Right now, we view the NNS as the only practical option (cf [Manu’s post in this thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754/142?u=manu)). This does not mean that the NNS could in future assign the control to another DAO and we look forward to ideas from the community on how to improve this.

Next steps:

* We will take some extra time and extend the “Chainalysis-KYT'' canister to allow multiple parties to provide API keys. The list of principals that are authorized to provide Chainalysis API keys are set via NNS proposals, and every authorized principal can provide one API key. The canister can then rotate via the available API keys, and remove ones that are not working. The provider of the API key used for a screening gets the rewards for that screening. We plan to submit three proposals next week:
  1. First, to install this Chainalysis KYT canister without any principals that can set API keys.
  2. Second, a proposal sets an initial list of principals that can provide API keys. This proposal will contain Toniqs principal, and other principals that are willing to participate.
  3. Third, a proposal to upgrade the ckBTC minter to use this KYT canister and enable BTC -> ckBTC conversions.
* After that, we will continue working to get other KTY providers to offer their services directly on chain so that no third party is needed to inject API keys into a KYT canister.

Thank you all for your insights in this forum and beyond, and for your support in shaping the future of the Internet Computer and its ecosystem!

We will be holding a [Twitter Space tomorrow](https://twitter.com/dfinity/status/1638932601661431809?s=20) at 15:00 CET to discuss this in more detail as a community.

Thank you Jan for clarifying some of the main issues raised

One question I have is the incentives for other key providers 

The current financial incentive means Toniq will never make profit off KYT structure 

Is there any incentives for other key providers to come forward?

At this point - it would have been appropriate to immediately make this public and put a call out for people to join

The elephant in the room here: 

Itll take some time to onboard KYT on chain since its out of our control that we need to have VOLUME first

Meanwhile, while we allow for multiple KYT subscription providers but not incentivized so we are essentially trying to get mass volume on ICP but with what could possibly be multiple single points of failure (Toniq + Chainkeyanalysis) 

Feel like we need more in the mid term to mitigate this

Going to say this once and we can move on since theres not much to argue 

Dfinity can and has been doing exactly this 

its also the reason no one believes this is decentralised or web 3

No one even believes Dfinity is on the road to decentralization nor will ever relinquish any form of true power 

this is exactly the reason for outflow of members both in dev and user, not out of crypto, but to solana, Aptos, ETH, Matic

In one direction, you would have more developers building, and each each with their own subcommunities keeping NFT markets and Web 3 social media active 

Instead we have current situation - DSCVR is heavily promoted by dfinity but if you use DSCVR PROPERLY you'll see the state of real people using it.... i.e. there isn't much even with promotion

Some official Dfinity spaces have like 29 listeners.... with the size of its supposed following... IT speaks volume <--- For some reason no one wants to hear it 

Ignore it, take it as a lie, push ahead with central decisions for a year and maybe see what happens when there is no support from internal and external web 3 community whos liquidity btw, is what people are after 

Maybe it all works out for you who knows, but Ill make sure all this is done in the light where possible

We should not forget that what makes the forum so large is that The boys hate Toniq's profit potential.
But many people are genuinely looking forward to ckBTC's release.

1. Deploying a version of ckBTC without KYT puts DFINITY at risk, even if the ckBTC canister is controlled by the NNS.
[/quote]

I believe this statement gets to the root of the matter.

I have asked repeatedly why Dfinity could not deploy ckBTC with *optional* KYT. It would be great for the IC, because it would leave the network free of a political slant (the way ETH remains politically neutral though many if not most nodes now conform to OFAC regulations). The answer is, it might be great for the IC but is potentially bad for Dfinity.

Here we see how the interests of Dfinity as an organisation and the IC as a network are not always aligned. Many people believe Dfinity will always work for the benefit of the IC, but the truth is that, like all organisations, Dfinity will always behave for the benefit of itself. In most cases, Dfinity and IC benefit from the same things, so the potential contradiction is not visible. This issue has made it starkly clear. I mean, given a choice between a blockchain that is politically neutral and one that is bound to American regulations, is there a single person among us who would choose the latter? I believe not, because transnationalism is a core tenet of crypto but that is where we are, because Dfinity is primarily concerned with itself. If push comes to shove, Dfinity will even spin off a for-profit from a non-profit the way Open AI did.

The only way forward is for the IC to be increasingly free of Dfinity's influence. But the only way this can happen is if Dfinity itself understands the importance of the move and steers it. Sadly, I see no impulse from Dfinity to structurally increase decentralisation and transparency. Besides, as has been pointed out often, the tokenomics of the IC is unique in providing greatest rewards to long-term stakers, who are also the biggest holders of ICP, which means the same oligarchy will continue to dominate voting in the future.

Now that it is clear an American bias will be embedded into the NNS and in the IC, I cannot continue to be part of the network, as I had mentioned upthread. No loss for the network, certainly a loss for me, because I had a lot of hopes for the IC. I will continue as a member of this forum only as a lurker while my neuron dissolves. Hopefully the liquidity crunch mapped by Kyle Langham that will take hold in late 2024 will allow a reasonable exit. I continue to have a vested interest in the IC's success, at least until then.

@Denis as someone who sympathizes with your posts, I think there are good reasons why a KYT/non-KYT option is not ideal. It's the same reason anarchies don't fare well against any form of government. Non-KYT simply loses against vested interests.

This is why ICP is actually a great opportunity. It brings about decentralization not through anarchy but democracy. Not because democracy is necessarily ideal, but because it's the best we can do. Your voice is needed to bring balance to this system.

And it's why I think an SNS is the best way to handle KYT:
https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-kyt-sns-ideas/19044/6?u=jonathan

This way we are still part of the same world, but everyone's voice matters. Please analyze and let me know what you think.

I think this is highly unfair. May I ask, what do you propose? That Dfinity ignore its legal counsel and put itself at risk? Is that a fair ask on any developer and entity on any blockchain? I’m not aware of any time in ETH or any chain where the analogous ask would has happened.

The IC as a blockchain is very neutral. 

ckbtc canister is a smart contract, and it is a bit of an unfair ask that any developer should put write a smart contract to put users and themselves at risk. Why should it be Dfinity? Why not any other entity? That, I believe, is the ethos of a web3. Why are other developers or yourself “off the hook” in deploying a canister that satisfies your intent?

The code is there… anyone can make their own choices.

Lastly…

To be clear: 

A.  ckbtc is NOT part of the protocol, it is one of many smart contracts that could do similar functionality.

B. And it is NOT an US-based bias. Many, many countries and many jurisdictions have the concept of KYT and tainted Bitcoin. Bitcoin-integration (for example) is completely neutral and part of the actual protocol. This is only for the smart contract of ckbtc. 

But alas… if you are not interested in the IC any more, no harm no foul. I respect folks have limited time and energy. I think myself and others clarified what needed clarifying, explained the trade offs, what needs to be improved, what is being improved, where feedback is necessary, and how more suggestions are welcomed, etc… and I am a bit disappointed that all this effort landed in your mind as “American bias.” 

Alas… no harm, no foul if you focus on other endeavors, I guess.

I hope you realise Toniq would have made a loss and loss alone....

Thanks to the current push back and debate, the model will be changed so both Toniq and other providers will be properly incentivised to hold subscription addressing the very solvable problem of internal single point of failure

We still have the chainkeyanalysis single point of failure which is going to take us succeeding as a defi platform to remove (or atleast that's what's been communicated)

Do feel we missed out on @skilesare suggestion which had some tradeoffs but could have been cheaper and more efficient

I think you misunderstood me, @diegop . Never suggested Dfinity should not have taken the path it did. In fact I said organisations will always think primarily about themselves. If I was in charge of Dfinity, I would have taken exactly the same decision, to safeguard Dfinity.

Does not mean it is good for the IC. In fact, in my opinion, this is very bad for the IC. Perhaps you are assuming that what is right for Dfinity must be right for the IC. I do not believe that to be the case. 

Thanks for responding, I remain interested in and invested in the IC, I am just not a cheerleader any more given the direction it is taking, and not just with KYT. But I do hope I am wrong and the IC will become what I had hoped it would. There are many great teams working on apps and the technical brilliance of the Dfinity team remains unquestioned. Over and out.

The only way forward is for the IC to be increasingly free of Dfinity’s influence. But the only way this can happen is if Dfinity itself understands the importance of the move and steers it. Sadly, I see no impulse from Dfinity to structurally increase decentralisation and transparency. Besides, as has been pointed out often, the tokenomics of the IC is unique in providing greatest rewards to long-term stakers, who are also the biggest holders of ICP, which means the same oligarchy will continue to dominate voting in the future.
[/quote]

You're not alone in feeling this and this has been one of the biggest downfall to growth 

I'm known to campaign for further decentralisation since last year but since then after many many conversations have come to understand Dfinity is in a very precarious position 

I'll still continue to push for Decentralisation since this is one of the biggest inhibitors to other web 3 community entries 

Saying this, when in a centralised position of power, this is a great example of how NOT to approach discussion and development

It's more important now than ever to be fully transparent and run every decisions through the forum 

While it's additional admin, it's also a small community so the impact is noticable


Anyways we digress from the threads purpose, a middle ground seems to be coming around nicely, I know dfinity keeps saying "just fork bro" but let's be real - ckBTC by dfinity handled by the NNS will have trust and will be mass adopted by default hence why the community places a lot on it 

I appreciate your thoughts on KYT and it's a very very difficult topic, I personally like that they leave it open for non KYT canisters while opening access to the US markets since ICP still needs to generate volume

I think this is highly unfair. May I ask, what do you propose? That Dfinity ignore its legal counsel and put itself at risk? Is that a fair ask on any developer and entity on any blockchain? I’m not aware of any time in ETH or any chain where the analogous ask would has happened.
[/quote]

No he's right there, people really do believe this - and it might just be because when there is a final decision, it's usually "This is what's been decided"

A first possible step would be to publicise why a decision was made the way they have in the summary but regardless people believe this for a reason so something's broken somewhere

The IC as a blockchain is very neutral

Yeah, even the blind dfinity supporters arguement is "Dfinity SHOULD do what they want"

From all my time here, icp does not feel like a neutral chain and this is a widely shared sentiment - the hope is, it will be more neutral over time

ckbtc is NOT part of the protocol, it is one of many smart contracts that could do similar functionality.
[/quote]
Understanding the optics will help you understand why there is so much placed on this.

A) if it's not part of the protocol, it's not expected to be released by dfinity. There is lots of misconceptions that it is

B) regardless, dfinitys releases come with inherent trust and hence it's almost certain to become the adopted BTC canister - meaning it will be difficult for other models to be implemented

This is the general feel, you should really have noticed this with activity in Dev forums aswell but if you haven't then, I can tell you, outside it's really taking effect.

I currently feel decentralisation is an insurmountable issue in the short run but all this could be managed better with processed and ways of working to limit most damage 




All that is just to express these points need to be onboarded not invalidated 

My personal belief is that Jan's suggestion yesterday has found a great tradeoff to release a more robust system to support our defi Infra - albeit at the cost of additional inflation and KYT is a necessity to tap into the US market while also allowing for non KYT versions to launch on IC

1. Networks only Promote themselves
2. Corruption challenges the legitimacy and effectiveness of political systems and institutions.
3. Only reason to not move towards decentralization is because they don't want to do so
4. DFINITY isn't neutral as long as it is run by Biased human beings.


[quote="Denis, post:432, topic:18754"]
Here we see how the interests of Dfinity as an organisation and the IC as a network are not always aligned. Many people believe Dfinity will always work for the benefit of the IC, but the truth is that, like all organisations, Dfinity will always behave for the benefit of itself. In most cases, Dfinity and IC benefit from the same things, so the potential contradiction is not visible. This issue has made it starkly clear. I mean, given a choice between a blockchain that is politically neutral and one that is bound to American regulations, is there a single person among us who would choose the latter? I believe not, because transnationalism is a core tenet of crypto but that is where we are, because Dfinity is primarily concerned with itself. If push comes to shove, Dfinity will even spin off a for-profit from a non-profit the way Open AI did.

Is the hope still to maintain an exact 1:1, or just to get something functionally close enough?
[/quote]

Due to transaction fees (burning ckBTC) and a (BTC) fee when retrieving BTC, there will be a surplus of BTC under the ckBTC minter's control. The current plan is to mint the difference in ckBTC periodically to pay for cycles. This mechanism is not yet implemented.
So, deviations from the targeted 1:1 ratio will be corrected continuously.

[quote]
1. What happens when ckBTC calls on tainted BTC that is labelled post-conversion?
[/quote]

Unfortunately, there is no (good) solution for this problem. The KYT check does not prevent this but it introduces a risk for a potential attacker in that the attacker may lose (tainted) bitcoins sent to the ckBTC minter.

[quote]
2. Given that ckBTC is liquid and will naturally be lost over time in an open system, what happens to the BTC that accumulates in the canister as a result?
[/quote]

Since the ratio should always be 1:1, the corresponding amount in BTC will remain with the ckBTC minter.

[quote]
Is the bad BTC tagged and sent to the bottom of the barrel?
[/quote]

Tagged UTXOs are not just sitting at the bottom, they are quarantined so they can't be used for any retrieval request.

Assume there is someone who unknowingly holds taintedBTC

Is there any risk of them losing their BTC during the minting process?

Yes, there is. If the BTC are tainted, they will be quarantined.

Two additions:
 1. The risk of someone unknowingly holding tainted BTC is, allegedly, very low because most people get their bitcoins from well known exchanges (which often/typically have a KYT process in place), so they most likely won't have any problems converting their BTC to ckBTC. I said "allegedly" because I'm not an expert in this field. That's what we were told when talking to KYT providers.
2. What happens to quarantined UTXOs? Unfortunately, KYT providers themselves don't have a good answer to this question. We are thinking about ways to get these UTXOs back out so that people don't lose their bitcoins if they are not at fault.

I have asked repeatedly why Dfinity could not deploy ckBTC with *optional* KYT. It would be great for the IC,
[/quote]
I don't understand your statement here.  It's not plausible for there to be an optional KYT for ckBTC.  However, there can be a nonKYT version of ckBTC such as ckBTC-1, ckBTC-2, etc, but those would be different tokens with different policies applied.  Anyone can spin up one of these alt ckBTC because DFINITY open sourced it.  Hence, there is an option to deploy a version of ckBTC that doesn't require KYT if someone decides to pursue it.  Maybe it would be great for the IC if a nonKYT version of ckBTC exists, but I don't believe that DFINITY is responsible for deploying it.

[quote="Denis, post:432, topic:18754"]

I have the opposite observation.  I think this topic has been the perfect example of how the interests of DFINITY as an organization and the IC as a network are very much in alignment.  I think the KYT issue is very important to protect ckBTC users and the proposal DFINITY has made seems well researched and fair to me.  I also think DFINITY has been transparent in their presentation of the issues and the solution.

I agree with the point you made in the first two sentences, but disagree with the last sentence.  I think decentralization is an important goal and DFINITY is the entity that has taken the most meaningful steps at pushing us toward decentralization of the protocol.  In my opinion, decentralization is not achieved by constantly shouting insults and criticisms or trying to incite the mob.  Decentralization comes from understanding the mechanisms that are built into the ICP to control change of the protocol and by a large number of people and organizations stepping up to actively contribute through their vote.  In my observation, DFINITY would like to see more organizations contribute to decentralization at this protocol level.  

[quote="Denis, post:432, topic:18754"]

I share the same perception - Dfinity has a huge impact, but as a foundation organization, it is at risk. I myself recognize that implementing KYT is not the best option, but I think it is the best option at this point if you have decided that the current situation is a legal risk. It is meaningful for the community to do what the foundation cannot do, which leads to decentralization.

I remain of the opinion that DAOs are free to behave as long as they do not infringe on anyone, and that is where the foundation and its members are the same. I do not think that repudiating actions is the only way to behave like a DAO.

JxBrian | 2023-03-24 13:54:19 UTC | #451

I shared an article yesterday, and I had to take it down because I believed most people found it controversial. 

However the point of the article was that, the US is not a monolithic country as many tend to believe. If you’ve lived in such a great country, you’ll be exposed to how diverse it is. Let’s say in this scenario with BTC; New York banned Bitcoin mining late last year.. on the other hand Texas is incentivizing Bitcoin miners to the state. So this KYT with Bitcoin is big enough to go to congress before it can be considered a legit option. According to my understanding KYT is not a law in the US, so why should I abide by it. To make this reasonable; think about a situation where a Texas resident uses a BTC to covert it to ckbtc for personal use. Then the BTC is confiscated by the KYT provider. In Texas people love their freedom, hence they have extended the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure to BTC keys. Maybe I’m not understanding fully what that means because I first don’t live in Texas and second I am not a law maker in that state. However what that signals is that the Texas resident would forward the matter to their governor about their BTC being under unreasonable search and seizure. The governor would then go ahead and find out from OFAC why the KYT exists and make an accusation of federal overreach and oversight against the Texas resident. This is due to the nature of legal actions against Texas residents; you have to have a search warrant to make a legal search and seizure for anything to hold ground in a court of law. This makes the action of KYT unconstitutional. Maybe I am wrong, but I’m ready to be corrected by Texas residents or whoever has better understanding.

b) **I think DFINITY's version comes with some trust, but I think others could easily gain trust. I think this thread underestimates the trust one can gain in Web3 (specially using immutability). Ironically, i think i under-value the trust of large organizations (like dfinity) while see the web3 power of small teams or solo devs to gain trust and usage. Analogously in ETH, Uniswap is a smart contract that came form a relatively-unknown developer in ETH.**  But more importantly... ckBTC-like functionality can exist with many different versions. No reason any a user needs to choose the same implementation. People can choose what they wish.

I still think this is the best of possible sub-optimal choices (although I think i think better ones may present themselves from the community, specially around governance) As I wrote earlier:

[quote="diegop, post:109, topic:18754"]
I just think reasonable compromise is “choose all”:

* DFINITY build a `ckBTC` that has high guarantees that users will get BTC they can trade (no surprises)
* DFINITY open source the work done so community can deploy their own with any permutations of rules they wish

My personal opinion (not DFINITY’s) is I think the “KYT vs not KYT” debate is best solved in the market of users/creators.

-------------------------

vavram | 2023-03-24 15:05:46 UTC | #457

Which is why it should be preferable for ckBTC to continue without KYT and then for Toniq and other exchanges to spin their own KYT-enabled version. Barring that, I don't see how anyone in the IC space can claim with a straight face that ckBTC is a token that's 1:1 equivalent to BTC

-------------------------

carioca | 2023-03-25 08:07:18 UTC | #460

A couple of thoughts:

Section 1: API Key Security Concerns
Holding an API key in a canister is not considered best practice due to the potential risks involved. In the event of a leak, KYT providers might suffer significant financial losses in the case of abuse.

Section 2: The Uniqueness of ckBTC
ckBTC has established itself as the de facto wrapped Bitcoin on the Internet Computer (IC). As a result, the name cannot be reused, and Dfinity will not promote alternative versions such as wBTC. This ensures that ckBTC maintains its prominence within the ecosystem.

Section 3: The Importance of NNS Control
People have come to trust ckBTC because it is under the control of the Network Nervous System (NNS). To maintain this trust, any subsequent wrapped Bitcoin implementations should also fall under NNS (or something with similar trust assumptions) control. However, doing so could become cumbersome and risky for developers, ensuring that ckBTC will always hold a special status since Dfinity will continue to vote on its proposals, but might not vote on proposals to manage other wrapped BTC implementations.

Section 4: Tainted BTC and Wrapping
Concerns have been raised regarding tainted Bitcoin after wrapping. @THLO mentioned that an attacker may lose their tainted BTC sent to the minter. It is unclear whether the minter returns or freezes the tainted BTC. In the event that the BTC becomes untainted, the ability to regain access is uncertain. Moreover, a coordinated attack could potentially allow an attacker to mint ckBTC before their BTC becomes tainted or have access to the API to check if their BTC is already considered tainted and only try and mint ckBTC in the case it isn't.

Section 5: The Risks of Halting Minting
The worst-case scenario of halted minting can have severe consequences for the ecosystem. It could lead to disruptions in token supply, reduced liquidity, and a loss of confidence in the wrapped token. Therefore, it is crucial to address potential risks and maintain the stability and trustworthiness of wrapped tokens like ckBTC.

ajismyid | 2023-03-26 15:42:24 UTC | #462

What about if ICP just define the rules, who can mint the ckBTC:

1. Whitelisted entities. eg. dfinity, CEX, any other legal entities. (which they have done their own internal KYT and guarantee the BTC not tainted).

2. BTC miners with their virgin BTC.

-------------------------

anonymous | 2023-03-26 19:34:57 UTC | #463

then ckBTC would be incredibly centralised.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2023-03-27 02:41:53 UTC | #464

Not really if the whitelisted process is done through NNS/SNS votes. It is just reiterate the same way onboarding new node providers.

Jonathan | 2023-03-28 03:39:36 UTC | #467

My impression, from this forum as well as the recent Twitter Space, is that this issue isn't entirely settled and the Dfinity team still need some space to consider the consequences.

KYT for crypto is nascent and confused, and neither the philosophical basis nor the legal ramifications have been fully established. 

I don't blame the team for delays at this point. If anyone thinks this is a simple issue, imo they probably don't understand it.

I feel that ICP should be staying on its roadmap of building the IC and not complicating the system with maintenance from marketers.

It seems to me that if we adopt outside of the roadmap then we will create ongoing cost and maintenance and move our attention away from the things we should spend time on.

My neighbor decided to get a dog as everyone out there is getting one and while I love animals I don’t follow the marketing bs.

The outcome 12 months later is they have paid thousands for the animal, then ongoing vet bills, constant walking the dog, repairs to their property and so on.

When my neighbor asks what I am doing today I respond with, Anything I want I don’t own a dog.

Don’t fall into the trap of Marketing that you need us and we will make your life better, nothing has changed for centuries. With all the law enforcement out there, there will always be work, maintenance and cost for them to do.

I believe that telling my neighbor that his decision for the small amount of goodness that comes from owning a dog will be outweighed by the maintenance would be met with argument and dismissal.

I like to think that the only way to learn is to let them do as they want and learn the hard way.

Let’s not learn the hard way, you are the one responsible at the end of the day for your mistakes and should have done the research before following the crowd and picking up dog shit.

It makes sense to me that permissionless DeFi will become a thing of the past. 

If regulators crack down, and I think they will, they’ll want to ensure DeFi applications 1) are not facilitating illicit transactions and 2) users are paying tax. 

I wonder if uniswap will be able to get away having their front end that doesn’t do any KYC or tax compliance forever… I just don’t see it happening. 

Look at Coinbase. Look at Binance. The dominos are falling. The whole our users aren’t American we don’t know if theyre using VPNs or not isn’t going to fly anymore. 

I expect a sea change on this front. Ever since FTX the regulators are really not happy and they will shake things up. I think…

Hello everyone

Hope you are all having a good day.

I am new to the forum and have been a trading ICP from 2021. I am a day trader whose sole income is crypto markets.

Since, I am not a developer, please forgive me for asking a question which may be obvious to you but someone like me may be struggling to understand.

What I understood from Dfinity R&D videos and blog posts is that ckBTC is basically wBTC that works in the icp Blockchain. I know there are technological and use differences. It would be nice if there was a post mentioning it.

My question is mainly concerned with tainted btc. I have never heard of tainted btc with regards to wBTC and everything can get exchanged seamlessly in Dex's. Why bring it up for ckBTC.

Good question.

Here is my understanding from reading Jan and other's posts (so take it with a grain of salt):

1. I also had not really heard of tainted BTC being an issue before

2. After talking with others in the industry, it seems it is an issue in CEX's (and more and more).

3. This is brought up in ckBTC because:

a. users of ckBTC may have bad user experiences where they find they swapped BTC for ckBTC and then get back BTC they cannot use at CEX's. Bad user experience.

b. Regulators are increasingly concerned with software that could act for money laundering, as has happened in US, EU, and other places:

Without intervention there is a risk that ckBTC canisters become seen functioning like a mixer with uncertain consequences. This has happened, for instance, to Tornado cash: it is blacklisted by the US Department of the Treasury, making it illegal for US citizens, residents, and companies to use.

As regulation continues to evolve around the crypto industry, doing nothing may put ckBTC canisters in the same category as Tornado Cash in the eyes of authorities in many countries.

Fwiw KYT is a welcome feature. I don't think most others have this and it will become increasingly more important over time.

The only issue is that what if that BTC is declared bad after it has been exchanged for ckBTC?

anonymous | 2023-04-09 19:46:19 UTC | #478

Still wondering if there's any update on this? When can we expect to have the minting and conversion of btc/ckbtc in the NNS UI?

Cost: Implementing KYT can be costly, particularly for smaller financial institutions. Solutions to this challenge include outsourcing KYT to a third-party provider or using open-source technology to reduce costs.
Data Quality: KYT relies on high-quality data, which can be difficult to obtain and maintain. Solutions to this challenge include investing in data management systems and processes and establishing data-sharing agreements with other institutions.
False Positives: KYT systems may generate false positives, which can be time-consuming to investigate and can result in unnecessary reporting. Solutions to this challenge include refining KYT algorithms and rules-based systems to reduce false positives and investing in staff training to improve the quality of investigations.
Limited Resources: Some financial institutions may have limited resources to dedicate to KYT, particularly smaller institutions. Solutions to this challenge include prioritizing KYT activities based on risk and investing in automation to improve efficiency.
Emerging Technologies: Emerging technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, present new challenges for KYT. Solutions to this challenge include investing in research and development to stay up-to-date with emerging technologies and partnering with technology providers to leverage their expertise.

I can answer your question. Wrapped Bitcoin on the Ethereum network is a product that requires both Know Your Customer and Know Your Transaction checks. To obtain wrapped Bitcoin, you need to send Bitcoin to a custodian/merchant who performs a transaction check on your Bitcoin and mints the equivalent token. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the legitimacy of your Bitcoin as a trusted entity has already taken care of the matter. KYT checks can include looking at the patterns of transactions, checking the source and destination of transactions, and looking for other signs of suspicious behavior. For instance, if BTC comes from an address flagged for illegal activity, the custodian may refuse the transaction or ask for more proof.

If the custodian becomes aware that the BTC that was sent to them to mint WBTC was stolen, the custodian may have a legal obligation to freeze or seize the funds and cooperate with law enforcement agencies to investigate and potentially return the stolen BTC to its rightful owner.

The exact legal framework for this may vary depending on the jurisdiction in which the custodian is operating and the specific circumstances of the case. But in general, custodians are expected to take reasonable steps to stop the acceptance of stolen or illegal funds and to work with law enforcement to look into and solve any cases where criminal activity is suspected.

IMO, ckBTC is a better version of this, as the entire minting procedure is done via smart contract while still providing similar security checks for those who want to hold cKBTC.

Hopefully, this answers your question.

A security exchange, also known as a stock exchange or a securities exchange, is a marketplace where stocks, bonds, and other securities are bought and sold. 

It provides a centralized and regulated platform for investors and traders to trade securities, thereby facilitating capital formation and providing liquidity to the securities market. Securities exchanges typically operate as for-profit organizations and can be either physical or electronic in nature. 

Some of the most well-known securities exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NASDAQ, and the London Stock Exchange.

I do not see any of that going on in the IC when our investment for me is locked for 8 Years, unable to exchange anything.

Do KYT fees only affect converting of BTC to ckBTC (i.e. deposits)? Is this different from the fee returned by get_deposit_fee in the ckbtc-minter.did?

Yes, get_deposit_fee is for BTC to ckBTC.
estimate_withdrawal_fee + kyt_fee for ckBTC to BTC

> Is this different from the fee returned by get_deposit_fee in the ckbtc-minter.did?

get_deposit_fee returns the kyt fee. This endpoint will be removed in the future in favor of get_minter_info.

Just to clarify, the answer is "no", a KYT fee is levied when converting BTC to ckBTC and vice versa.

@0rions provided the details: When converting BTC to ckBTC, the KYT fee is the only fee. When converting ckBTC to BTC, the fee consists of the withdrawal fee and the KYT fee.

KYT happens on withdrawal? How and why?

A KYT check on the destination *Bitcoin address* is performed to prevent the ckBTC minter from sending bitcoins to tainted addresses.

superduper | 2024-03-08 15:58:54 UTC | #489

i see this is a necro thread.... odd that many questions haven't been answered, so 4 concerning scenarios:


1. if a user of DeFi gets a hold of some BTC via various swaps and tries to convert it to ckBTC, but the KYT system flag it (unbeknownst to them somehow they swapped with some tainted coins) what happens to the users BTC?  Does the protocol send them back? Are they frozen?  what recourse does the user have besides filing a lawsuit with the KYT provider?

2. same scenario as #1 but in the users jurisdiction the coins he possess are not regarded as "tainted"

3. the user is in a country that has int'l sanctions applied to it at the jurisdiction of the KYT provider (for example the user is in Iran or North Korea), since their is no KYC, if it then later gets shown that his address belongs to a North Korean or Iranian, what happens?

4. similar case to #3, the btc address shows up later on the banned list...

without answers to these questions i don't see ckBTC getting big volumes

-------------------------

THLO | 2024-03-13 14:29:30 UTC | #490

The [ckBTC wiki page](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Chain-key_Bitcoin) explains what currently happens when "tainted" UTXOs are sent to the ckBTC minter.
In short, they are quarantined indefinitely. Note that just sending them back is problematic because the ckBTC minter shouldn't send "tainted" UTXOs around. Additionally, there are some technical challenges: the Bitcoin transaction that transferred the UTXO to the ckBTC minter can have multiple inputs associated with different addresses. It is not clear which input address should be used as the "return address".

I don't know to what extent different jurisdictions would classify bitcoins differently. I'm assuming that KYT providers follow the recommendations of the FATF, which has quite a few [members](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/fatf.html), but yes, it is possible that other countries handle AML differently.

Regarding your questions 3 and 4, once ckBTC has been minted, this operation cannot be undone, so users cannot suddenly lose their funds at a later stage.

The whole KYT process is meant to ensure that users can always withdraw "clean" bitcoins. We also feel that the quarantine process should be improved somehow. Once we have a reasonable strategy, we will certainly announce it and request feedback. If anybody on the forum has good suggestions, please post them here!

I still do not understand, for example, when someone sends BTC to the miner and ckBTC is minted, but information about a blacklisted sender address appears later. What happens with the tainted BTC and the already minted ckBTC? If the tainted BTC is quarantined, who will bear the difference in the uncovered ckBTC balance 1:1?

[quote="ajismyid, post:491, topic:18754"]

[/quote]

Nothing happens to the minted ckBTC. The ckBTC tokens may have already circulated, so there is no good way to remove them from the system.

As you correctly pointed out, there is a remaining risk that some UTXOs are declared "tainted" later. This risk is considered small and is currently accepted.

Even if the risk is small, something bad might happen eventually and, as I mentioned above, we're thinking about ways to improve the KYT mechanism.
One approach under consideration is the following: Since the ckBTC minter performs KYT checks, it could report the UTXOs that it manages to the KYT provider(s), which could then mark these UTXOs as part of the "ckBTC service". If the KYT provider(s) consider ckBTC trustworthy (which should be the case), the reported UTXOs should remain "clean".

If you have other ideas/questions, let me know!

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-03-18 14:00:24 UTC | #493

Just rough ideas, rather than only depend on passive approach, what about proactive approach by separating the risk levels of the source of Bitcoin addresses? By categorizing deposits according to their perceived risk levels, we can apply varying degrees of waiting periods before minting ckBTC tokens. Such as:

* **Virgin Bitcoins (Low Risk):** Deposits made up entirely of freshly mined coins with no previous transaction history are generally deemed lower risk since they haven't passed through many hands. You can mint these ckBTC tokens instantly upon receiving them without applying any waiting period.

* **Official Institutional Deposits (Medium Risk):** When receiving BTC deposits from officially recognized institutions like registered cryptocurrency exchanges, custody services, or OTC desks, the risk profile increases slightly due to increased exposure to potential money laundering. Apply a short waiting period, say one hour, during which time the source of the funds can be verified by KYT providers. Upon completion of verification checks, proceed to mint ckBTC tokens.

* **Anonymous Addresses (High Risk):** Transactions originating from anonymous wallets pose a higher risk of being tied to malicious activities. For such cases, introduce a longer waiting period—for example, twenty-four hours—during which further investigation and analysis can be carried out by KYT provider(s).

Hello everyone, I am fairly new to the crypto eco system and have just had the issue that has been described above by some. I bought some BTC on tradeogre, and sent it to my NNS wallet to convert to ckBTC. From what I had read, the idea of ICP sounded very interesting. It is true decentralization, unlike any other coin. 

However, I am now told that the BTC I sent is flagged by your KYT process, and is now quarantined.. indefinitely. I cannot have access to my BTC, and have no way to recover it. I am perplexed beyond belief. This stands against the ethos of Bitcoin and of decentralisation. It is not anarchistic. It is not even democratic. It is authoritarian. Through no fault of my own I have bought some bitcoin which has apparently been used in the past in some illicit way, and judgement has been passed with no recourse. The US government looks like a saint in comparison.

Furthermore this acts heavily against the interests of the ICP project. I had no way of knowing that my BTC was going to be put into quarantine before I sent it. There was no warning. I am sure what happened to me has/ will happen to others and it will become known that if you send your BTC to the ICP ecosystem there is a small chance of losing it. It is clear what will follow. Why would anyone risk losing their BTC ? Unless a solution is found this is a hole below the waterline for the ICP project.

Given that ICP is truly decentralized, I do not know why there is so much concern over how authorities will act towards you.

-------------------------

Jonathan | 2024-03-28 00:54:32 UTC | #495

I think the main problem is that the "tainted" BTC you put in might be withdrawn by someone else, leaving them with Bitcoin that can't be redeemed on an exchange.

Your situation may not seem fair, but "buyer beware" is considered more fair than the scenario above. Does tradeogre utilize KYC? If so, I'd recommend you contact them about this. If not, it can be considered a risky place to do business.

For the record, I think there must ultimately be a better solution to this problem. But for now this is the reality.

-------------------------

ajismyid | 2024-03-28 00:55:29 UTC | #496

I agree with the issue raised here. It is unfair to users who will mint ckBTC if their BTC is suddenly quarantined without prior warning. I do not know what/how the KYT procedure is, but if the KYT provider can warn users before they deposit BTC to the minter, it would be better.

# Update on DFINITY's view on KYT

When ckBTC was launched, DFINITY proposed using Chainalysis KYT to screen BTC coming into ckBTC, and screen addresses when converting ckBTC back to BTC. The main reason for this proposal was the concern that BTC that is considered “tainted” by certain entities could make it into the pool of BTC managed by the ckBTC minter. Other users may end up withdrawing that BTC, and as a result have a more difficult time using this BTC for example at centralized exchanges. DFINITY’s proposal was adopted, and therefore ckBTC has been running with Chainalysis KYT integration since inception in April 2023.

## Experience from a year with Chainalysis KYT

In this year of having ckBTC with Chainalysis KYT integration, some new insights have been gained. There is no definition of tainted bitcoin, meaning that everybody has their own set of rules. This makes it impossible to guarantee that all bitcoin coming out of ckBTC would be accepted by CEXes without question. The ckBTC minter therefore takes a very conservative approach and quarantines all funds that could be considered questionable. This has led to funds being quarantined by the ckBTC minter that seem innocent, for instance funds coming from a BTC ATM and from a non-KYC centralized exchange.

## New proposal by DFINITY

DFINITY proposes to remove the Chainalysis KYT integration from the ckBTC canisters. There are a lot of advantages to this:

* Currently KYT fees of 2000 sats (= 1.25 USD today) are charged whenever converting between ckBTC and BTC. By removing the Chainalysis KYT integration, the fees for converting between BTC and ckBTC can be significantly reduced.
* It removes a centralized dependency from ckBTC.
* Users can be sure that their funds will be accepted by ckBTC, so there won’t be cases anymore where user funds are quarantined which the user did not expect.

How would the ckBTC minter canister deal with BTC that is currently quarantined as it was flagged by Chainalysis? We propose that the ckBTC minter canister re-evaluates quarantined funds after upgrade according to the new rules (which is a check of OFAC sanctioned addresses, see below), and proceed to process the deposit if valid according to the new rules.

But how would the concern of “tainted” BTC be addressed? We now think that this risk can be managed. It is important to note that ckBTC is never mixing funds: Whenever BTC is converted into ckBTC, this can be traced using the [ckBTC minter dashboard](https://mqygn-kiaaa-aaaar-qaadq-cai.raw.ic0.app/dashboard). ckBTC can be traced on the ckBTC ledger, and finally conversions back to BTC are again traceable on the ckBTC minter dashboard. This means that whenever a ckBTC user would be challenged to explain the source of funds e.g. by a CEX, the user can show all steps. To further help avoid such cases, DFINITY is trying to work with parties like Chainalysis to explain how BTC can be traced across conversions into and out of ckBTC. That being said, it is impossible for ckBTC to guarantee that all entities like CEXes like the BTC coming out of ckBTC because they all use their own analysis which is not publicly available. Therefore, this remains a risk that all ckBTC users should be aware of.

**OFAC**

The regulatory and legal climate for DeFi is inconsistent and uncertain today across different jurisdictions. Whilst DFINITY remains a firm believer in an open, accessible, decentralized, cross chain financial base layer, the current state of affairs is that we see many crypto projects have serious issues with OFAC enforcement. It has been [reported](https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/) that BTC miners are increasingly adhering to OFAC address screening.

To reduce the risk to all participants in the Internet Computer ecosystem, we propose that the new ckBTC minter canister continues with, and extends the OFAC address screening it does today.

The current ckBTC canister incorporates checking of addresses against the OFAC sanctioned list for ckBTC -> BTC transfers. Transfers to an OFAC listed address are blocked. As removal of Chainalysis KYT from the ckBTC canister would open up the possibility of incoming transfers from addresses on the sanctioned list, DFINITY proposes to add code to the ckBTC minter canister to screen for OFAC listed addresses for BTC -> ckBTC transfers. Effectively funds sent from sanctioned BTC addresses will continue to be placed in quarantine.

Since the OFAC list is a fixed list at any point in time, users will know beforehand whether the ckBTC minter will accept their BTC.

## Discussion

Please let us know what you think. Do you support this proposal, do you have a different idea, or would you rather stick with the status quo?

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2024-06-24 11:50:21 UTC | #499

As long as transactions are traceable makes not sense at all for DFINITY to act as a police officer. 
That actually makes people dont trust on IC, due to centralized behavior of KYT.
IMO KYT was a mistake from the beginning.

-------------------------

hokosugi | 2024-06-24 12:33:44 UTC | #500

Agree. KYTs are unnecessary if the definition of contaminated BTC is vague and it proves difficult to control all contaminated BTC.
It is never too late to mend.

-------------------------

superduper | 2024-06-24 16:09:21 UTC | #501

oh finally common sense prevails... btw the OFAC list updates probably need to be voted on by the NNS or whatever, there should also be a way to freeze an account (pending DAO vote) in case of hacked funds moving through the system. however that would require some sort of rapid fire vote, perhaps a sort of decentralized group on "sentinels" can be delegated to by the DAO in order to do that.

might also consider that a new address locks up some ICP for 6mo. to be able to use all of this, and the yield goes to pay for the sentinels

-------------------------

ZackDS | 2024-06-26 11:36:51 UTC | #502

100% agree and support this. As one of few using this feature multiple times a week (didn't mind the fee per say but checking in advance for clean BTC was a pain) it is a welcomed change.

-------------------------

timo | 2024-06-26 12:31:08 UTC | #503

How does OFAC checking work? Is the OFAC list mirrored on-chain by a canister and made available to all other canisters by an inter-canister call? That would be helpful for all other DeFi projects as well, not only ckBTC.

Note that the OFAC list is already [hard-coded in the ckBTC minter](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/master/rs/bitcoin/ckbtc/minter/src/blocklist.rs).
If there is a need, it wouldn't be hard to expose this list to other canisters.
Do you have some concrete projects in mind that would benefit from this?

With all due respect Manu, this is exactly what we were trying to point out back when we were objecting to the idea of KYT in the first place. The somewhat fluid and very much political nature of the definition of "tainted Bitcoin" meant that this was bound to be a bad idea. I for one am happy that this is the outcome but it would have been more appropriate and less damaging/inconvenient for the ICP community (developers and others) if the feedback from the community had been more seriously considered at the time. 

In the end, good, but more thought is needed with such decisions in future to consider the potential impact. At least nobody will have to be concerned that their BTC may be confiscated. Proposal supported of course :slight_smile:
