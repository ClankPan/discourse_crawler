While we're discussing single point of failures on Toniq today, which is a much more pressing matter, we haven't even begun to touch on single points of failure from the KYT Provider 

This is also very important and we need to discuss how this particular risk can be mitigated after concluding the Toniq issue

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 10:56:40 UTC | #306

Also do we have full confidence that these KYT calls cannot be spoofed in any way?

I suppose this comes into how the KYT subscription is handled by Toniq and how much freedon others have to handle it but this is super important to look at if we havent already 

Apologies in advance if it has and Ive missed it

Feel like after this, we're ready to go

ckBTC done the right way 

a reliable and trusted service (Cant be decentralised till NNS is truly decentralised)

> For the record. The ICA is meant to be a members organization, but there are two challenges that have put its development on the back burner: (1) there are far more important things for the team to be working on right now, (2) we could not transfer legal ownership of ICP to the ICA for tax reasons; essentially that it would involve a gift, and in Zürich, where DFINITY is based, a substantial gift tax would be involved. So for now it controls voting neurons for security purposes (distribution of keys etc) and that’s it. We have ideas about how to fix this, and develop the organization, but it’s going to be a major undertaking, and we don’t have the bandwidth right now. Period.


Hadn't realised that. Thank you!

Just stop crying theguy .

You demand this and that ..how about putting your head down alittle and start researching instead ?

Toniq researched everything first and proposed to dfinity as a solution first . And what did you do ? You complained first . At least you are first in something lol

I'm honestly hoping toniq will give up on this and see who's willing to earn basically nothing and in risk of losing money. Talk is cheap . No one will step up to do anything . People here complained about wpb previously , till now not a single one has stepped up. Lmfao

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 13:06:27 UTC | #311

Toniq deciding they're operating at a loss so they no longer want to pay is the EXACT situation we need to prepare for. 

Toniq giving up on this will force dfinitys hand to consider a more robust ckBTC architecture which I cannot see as a bad thing 


Nothing is worse than the FUD you get from users expecting a service and it being unavailable 

Currently there is no expectations so we can actually deliver a resilient system from the get-go

I flagged my interest in this topic right at the start. I've got a meeting with chainalaysis tomorrow. Why wasnt I quicker? I had no idea that Dfinity would be up for a quick fix like this. Not given their prior comments about other single points of failure. 

I get your emotion.. but telling folk to stop crying isnt helpful. There are plenty of people who have questions. 

It might be that the Dfinity/ Toniq plan is the best option however there is a lack of reasoning which addresses the valid concerns of the community.

I think you are misrepresenting my point.  My point was Toniq did a lot of groundwork starting when Jan raised the issue almost a month ago in this thread.  That put them in a position to be ready to go at this point.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 13:16:30 UTC | #316

Actionable steps have been mentioned multiple times here, we're simply waiting on what dfinity plans to do. You can read through the chain to identify them.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 13:17:48 UTC | #317

And because of this its ok to go ahead with a single point of failure design

its not even clear if more will want to pay since apparently toniq is operating at a loss? so how is this model sustainable or resilient?

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-22 13:23:30 UTC | #318

If we have to go with a single point of failure (while we look for better options) - why isnt that point of failure Dfinity? 

I would suggest that more people would be happy with this. Nothing personal against Toniq.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 13:28:29 UTC | #319

Or even just do both, and put out official doc on how to join the KYT Sub crew 

We already have to trust Dfinity since they control the NNS, so having them as the point of failure is atleast less parties involved (I've detailed the reasons why before)

-------------------------

I have to reiterate this 

users don't care about much other than, does it work and is it easy to use 

and we're really going ahead with something that can create noise on the user side at the detriment of end users and ICP reputation 

All weve had so far is that our tech is solid and we should not compromise this

 A DIFFERENT THREAD NEEDS TO BE MADE FOR DEVELOPERS TO COLLABORATIVELY WORK ON:

1. Developing a KYT canister that incorporates multiple regulators. (because it’s highly likely that a decision has been made to permanently…let toniq be an oversight body of ckbtc) 

2. Developing a non-KYT ckbtc (although this might be hard; if some of dfinity employees chip in then it’s just a matter of time.) 

3. Start design of a SNS model that would hand over ckbtc business operations to the community. Community participation is highly needed as not a single entity cannot be up against dfinity but rather have a reasonable working relationship towards the future of decentralization.

@theguy i won’t be able to make the space due to work but I just wanted to say that while I completely agree with your points about transparency, and about Toniq being a single point of failure, I do agree with proceeding with the current plan that DF has laid out.

I don’t agree with the way this was handled; but, I also acknowledge that blocking this would rob the network of this capability. If we do that it will be just as bad as the risk you are worried about with Toniq causing an outage..

It’s not ideal but it is the current state of things.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 14:11:06 UTC | #327

Thankyou Lightning! 

Personal view is, I don't understand the wider impact of delaying this while Devs consult in  another thread for a better solution like @JxBrian said 

I personally don't agree with going forward as dfinity has shown before that it moves resources to more "Sexy" development meaning this could be the state for the forseeable future till there is an incident 

Plus I don't understand how Dominic can live with himself after attacking AWS for centralization for months and now releasing something with a central point of failure.Its embarrassing for him. Its embarrassing for us as a chain and its embarrassing for me as someone who tries to reach out to the wider web 3 community

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 14:12:43 UTC | #328

Failing this ofc, just let dfinity do it, or just onboard a few others, no ones been given the opportunity, what stops us from doing this from the get go? 

I have 0 understand of this and I guess I disagree that this is just the current state as I think some actions with quick turnaround can be taken

-------------------------

dymayday | 2023-03-22 14:17:40 UTC | #329

As @Manu and @Jan said multiple times, it's fairly easy and anyone can spin up its own ckBTC solution, **so why toniq isn't spinning their own then** ?

I personally have no trust in toniq and trusting DFinity is as far as I can push my trust in a centralized entity.

Then toniq will have what they want for their targeted (US) users, a toniq version of the "ckBTC, powered by ICP", and gated by their KYT provider of choice, for their jurisdiction. (They could even setup a SNS at some point if they want to hand over their ckBTC version)

I cannot think of anyone that is already fine with the current proposition from the foundation that could complain with what I just propose. Or is there anything else that the foundation is not telling us ?

This way the ckBTC feature will stay as a tool for anyone to pick up and tweak for their needs and not a flawed solution from the start.
I see no reason why the foundation and the NNS should be involved in this. And if there is a fuck up at some point, both of their reputation will be safe.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 14:21:33 UTC | #330

And neither should anyone have to trust any other entity other than Dfinity when using an NNS held service! Its bad enough we have to trust the KYT service let along Toniq in the middle 

Also a very good point that maybe @bob11 can tackle along with @NS01 s previous points

-------------------------

anonymous | 2023-03-22 15:34:13 UTC | #331

If this is the route Dfinity wants to go, let it happen. I trust in their judgement. Surely they wouldn't have worked so hard on ckBTC that they wouldn't want to tarnish it.

With all due respect, I just wanted to ask specifically about the above statement on timing. For those of us who're actively seeking funding, and for pilot customers, not delivering on our words is terribly damaging to an entrepreneur's / startup's image, in an already negative economic environment. Following the healthy discussions on this thread, my only ask from the leadership at DFINITY is to make an announcement if/when there's going to be a deviation from the above timing statement, before delays occur, so that entrepreneurs can do expectancy management better with their lifeline of prospect investors & pilot-customers. The last time a very respected person from DFINITY tweeted "in the coming weeks" for ckBTC, those of us who took that literally took a beating unfortunately. Hence my ask. For the record, I think DFINITY rocks :star_struck:, and it's irrelevant how underrated IC is for us buiDLers out there.

For something as big as ckBTC, I personally wouldnt want a little SNS running it, entrusted with billion dollar worth of people's BTCs. I dont know if anyone would trust it. It should remain with the NNS. Forks of it can be ran by SNSs.
Tainted BTC seems like can wreck havoc of you have ckBTC that isnt backed by usable BTC. So I hope to see incentives for more KYT providers to join in.

-------------------------

wpb | 2023-03-22 16:14:32 UTC | #334

I think these concerns have already been addressed in this forum thread, but at this point it’s hard to find because some of the typical actors have decided to confuse the proposal details with endless posts and misinformation.  If you just focus on the information provided by @Jan and @bob11 then I’d be surprised if you still have these concerns.  In my opinion, the proposal should be evaluated based on the content of the proposal as described by the author.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-22 16:28:28 UTC | #335

@Kyle_Langham Thanks for the call today 

Can we make transparent what the initial fees will be for the KYT Sub provider?

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 16:39:20 UTC | #336

"I understand why you want ckBTC shipped really fast"
Honestly, I think everyone wants it to be shipped, Dfinity and Toniq and the community included. I think it will be a massive benefit to the ICP ecosystem as a whole. To be extra clear, we're not pushing for cutting corners in order to release as soon as possible. Dfinity has done all of the development here, and they are fairly uncompromising when it comes to releasing products. For example, 12 confirmations is 2x what WBTC uses on ETH, but they didn't feel comfortable reducing it further right now. This shows how conservative the foundation is in releasing product. So none of this is half baked. All is well thought out.

"there is no financial reason to be a KYT provider"
Anyone building a business leveraging KYT has an incentive to ensure ckBTC stays up and running. This includes DeFi projects, SoFi projects, and NFT projects. In our case, we're building a business leveraging ckBTC as the primary currency, so we are incentivized to ensure that ckBTC works properly. Other dApps will likely feel the same way. So I think this is the incentive.

"I imagine they will tell me the price and that will be a no-go for us"
Yeah, it is pretty expensive. Not ideal, but it is what it is for now.

"They might not have the same view as yourself and could just switch off the service?"
In the case that a KYT provider fails to provide KYT, it will be known very quickly and Dfinity (or anyone) would need to submit a new proposal to add a new principal to the KYT canister to add a new API key. However, you have to sign a 1-year contract up front for Chainalysis, so we're essentially guaranteed a 1 year window already with an initial API key.

"does the call go to a Toniq server as a middle man"
There is no middle man. The KYT canister will be NNS controlled, and the KYT provider only has permissions to add API key. So no point of failure here.

"Then why is that not Dfinity?"
This is probably better for Manu or Jan to answer as they'll have more context from the Dfinity side.

Thanks for the thoughtful reply. All good questions.

Before toniq entered in the equation… how did dfinity plan on paying for the KYT canister. 

Or was that not thought about..?

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 17:24:20 UTC | #338

The idea was always to find someone (or multiple someones) willing to be a KYT provider.

KYT meaning:

1. Accept payments in ckBTC
2. Add API key into the KYT canister

Dfinity was talking with many people about trying to fill this need. A few KYT providers (Chainalysis, Elliptic, and a few more), a few businesses, I think even a foundation. KYT providers don't do things like this, so it was a hard sell.

Then Toniq offered to be the KYT provider (get a Chainalysis subscription, accept payments in crypto, and interact with a canister to insert and rotate API keys).

Dfinity is still in conversations with others who may (or may not) be willing to be a KYT provider.

Payment would be from fees collected from the ckBTC minting process.

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-22 17:24:12 UTC | #339

Thanks for the reply Bob! 

The 1 year contract is a good point. If the canister is calling the API direct then this give a bit more security. 

I do appreciate your role in helping Dfinity/ ckBTC. Nothing that I'm saying is a direct reflection on trust in Toniq. Its purely an academic discussion about process/ design. 

I dont think we're at the optimal solution. but it's sounding like for legal reasons etc we might be initially stuck this way. 

I hope long term there is a move to remove any single point of failure. The issue with adding more keys is a smaller chuck of fees for each party making it even more tricky. Not easy!

[quote="JxBrian, post:337, topic:18754"]
how did dfinity plan on paying for the KYT canister.
[/quote]

The reason got my inquiry is; if that money that was supposed to fund KYT is laying somewhere now that toniq has taken over than responsibility.. then I’d like to propose for a loan or grant to fuel a canister that will adopt multiple KYT regulators on board. 
I have a non profit that would directly benefit as a result of such a business nature. 

Personally I would prefer a non-KYT ckbtc but it would be nearly impossible to get a grant for such a canister. 

However, I am comfortable overseeing development of a multiple agency regulatory KYT canister system. 
Even if I would want to solely build a multi-KYT mechanism, I would still have to fund that canister for operational cost and money is a big issue for startups. 

So how did dfinity envision funding KYT and are there grants available for development of other systems other than what is currently being worked on?

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 17:25:51 UTC | #341

Yes, although at volume you get cheaper per call pricing. So I think there is a case for multiple KYT providers (2/3 consensus perhaps) and at volume it is still affordable. This is one ideal path forward, though there may be others.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 17:29:14 UTC | #342

Yeah, I don't think there are any funds set aside. The plan has always been to pay for the per call KYT pricing with a per call fee at the ckBTC minter level. So if cost per call is $0.50 (yes, KYT calls are expensive) then you peel off $0.50 worth of ckBTC in the minting process and send it back to the KYT canister for the KYT provider to cover the per call pricing. The KYT subscription has to be paid upfront, so you pay some 5 figure sum upfront, and then you get per call fees back. So initially out quite a bit of money, but then you make it up over time as you get volume.

Wow, great info @bob11 

How is this scalable? 

Say you have a millions calls, hypothetically at $0.50 per call then the operational cost is at nearly $500K? Math isn’t my strength but from my understanding of those numbers there will be no competition on such a system. Basically one KYT company will dictate how transactions are done. 

Now, what if there are multiple KYT for ckbtc; competition could definitely drive the price down. One KYT entity might say our price to developers is set to hypothetically $0.50. Then another KYT might say something like, the first transaction in our system is $0.50 and after that, since this person making the call is in our system and the customer is also in our system now we will charge the second and multiple transactions at $0.25 which is half the cost. You see, such a system is scalable as there is competition in the market to attract more customers. 

Maybe I am thinking about this too simplistically , correct me if I’m wrong…who is paying for KYT cost. In this case say  that it’s toniq, do they bill the developer of a dApp to use the service? Or do they cover the cost for the developers making calls to the KYT canister. 

Now if there is no KYT, then there is no operational cost. However I see why some jurisdictions might want KYT. So let’s go with a system that has multiple KYT. Is the above scenario I described do-able ?

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 17:59:58 UTC | #344

The per call price decreases as you scale up volume. So the more KYT calls the less you pay per call. Once there is volume, then there is leverage to get better pricing from KYT providers.

And then users are the ones paying the KYT cost as a built-in wrapping fee. So take the per call price on the KYT side and build it into the ckBTC minter canister to cover that price. Does that make sense?

-------------------------

JxBrian | 2023-03-22 18:34:21 UTC | #345

I don’t like how you say that there is better pricing form KYT providers with increase in volume. What we are talking about here is a decision that has been taken that has chosen toniq as a KYT provider and not other KYT providers…because all those other KYT have not set foot on the IC yet. 

Now back to your point, while describing about dissolving neurons dfinity had a formula that took consideration of time and amount locked in to calculate how much customers would be rewarded. 
In this case I think toniq has to provide transaction costs formula. Is it cheaper is someone converts 100BTC compared to a 1BTC; in the conversion to ckbtc. How much cheaper is it for a customer converting for the 1000th time compared to the 2nd time. Does the amount of BTC being converted play a role in reduction of the transactional cost? 
You say it is cheaper with leverage, but what is taken into consideration when calculating that? 

What I fail to understand is the role of KYT costs. It is fair that toniq volunteered to take operational cost but how much money they are spending is important to know. In this case what I am not understanding is say that I want to send 100BTC or convert 1BTC to ckbtc.  If I am using dApp XYZ on the IC does that mean that the developer would pay for the operational cost for the 100BTC to be converted to ckbtc. And if no, that the developer of a dApp won’t pay, does the cost of using KYT go to the customer ? 
To my understanding if the customer is being charged $$$ then there won’t be 1:1 parity between cbtc and BTC conversions. That is because there is a charge of KYT in the equation. The explanation is that if the customer is paying for the transactional cost then they won’t be getting their full BTC in the conversion. A small amount would be lost as a result of conversion to ckbtc. Now multiply this with the Law of large numbers and ckbtc wont be attractive to big investors or high transactional business entities.

-------------------------

singularity | 2023-03-22 18:53:56 UTC | #346

Could be something like for 1 BTC, 1ckBTC is generated, with 0.999ckBTC going to the user and 0.001ckBTC going to a charges collections account but still within the ckBTC circulating supply, not burnt. So still 1:1.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 18:56:36 UTC | #347

Yes this is exactly how it works. 1 BTC in 1 ckBTC out, but .999975 ckBTC to the user and .000025 ckBTC to fees (assuming $0.50 fee).

theguy | 2023-03-22 20:06:56 UTC | #348

bob11 | 2023-03-22 20:12:08 UTC | #349

Based on the legal and compliance research I have done, I think you either block US citizens from using your platform, or you use KYT to ckBTC, ckETH, ckUSDC, etc. Applies to everything I think.

In that case, we would have more ckBTC in circulation than retrievable BTC in the ckBTC minter, which must never happen.
The ckBTC minter must be able to serve any valid retrieval request eventually.

I apologize if I missed it, but was this problem ever solved? Is the hope still to maintain an exact 1:1, or just to get something functionally close enough?

The two problems I'm asking about are:

1) What happens when ckBTC calls on tainted BTC that is labelled post-conversion?
2) Given that ckBTC is liquid and will naturally be lost over time in an open system, what happens to the BTC that accumulates in the canister as a result?

Is the plan to have these disparities offset one another? Is the bad BTC tagged and sent to the bottom of the barrel?

Again, I apologize if I missed something. This thread has become quite lengthy and somewhat discombobulated.

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-22 22:27:25 UTC | #353

Based on my understanding:
1. You don't KYT the ckBTC on the way out (since you did KYT on the way in). You only KYT the destination address to prevent the protocol from sending BTC to a high risk destination. The withdrawer can always just input a different address to receive their BTC. This means there will always be an exact 1:1 BTC <> ckBTC.
2. This is a great question. Likely locked in the protocol forever in its current implementation due to the exact 1:1 nature of BTC <> ckBTC.

-------------------------

FOX | 2023-03-22 22:47:33 UTC | #354

Sorry.
I was wondering, what is the benefit of attacking a single point of failure in KYT?
If Toniq has centralized control over the keys to the ckBTC canisters, that is a big problem, but my understanding is that KYT is a function to check for tainted BTC, not a function that should be at risk of BTC being hacked from the wallet due to a vulnerability in KYT.

My conclusion remains the same for the concern that Toniq's KYT not functioning properly could bring ckBTC to a halt, and I think the best course of action is to diversify by adding more potential new providers.

Sorry if I am wrong in my opinion. The thread has grown into a business discussion and I still don't understand what you are talking about lol

-------------------------

ratdi90 | 2023-03-23 00:43:12 UTC | #355

Alternatively, it seems possible to create a CKBTC canister without KYT. dfinity understands the risk of publicizing a canister without KYT, so the creation of such a canister from an anonymous user should be welcomed.

I'd like to direct you to the OP from @Jan where he explains the proposal.  There is nothing in the proposal about handing Toniq the keys to the ckBTC canister.  Nor will they have access to the BTC.  I know it is very confusing at this point due to the sensational responses that have thoroughly populated this forum post.  Here is what Jan included in his proposal that addresses your concern...

[quote="Jan, post:164, topic:18754"]
About the KYT Canister

The KYT canister is to be handed over to the NNS, which means future updates to this canister will only be possible via NNS proposals. The KYT canister will accept a Chainanalysis API key from a designated principal. Initially, this designated principal – which is able to update the API key – will be controlled by Toniq. Changing the designated principal or adding other ones will be via NNS proposals.
[/quote]

The proposal is to hand over the KYT canister to the NNS and to designate Chainalysis as the first KYT provider.  It is also to gives Toniq the ability to change and update their API key, which Chainanalysis requires to perform the work of KYT.  Chainanalysis is performing the KYT work, not Toniq.  Neither Toniq or Chainanalysis has access to the BTC.  Toniq controls nothing more than their own API key for Chainanalysis.  The NNS will control the KYT canister and the ckBTC canister.

My conclusion remains the same for the concern that Toniq’s KYT not functioning properly could bring ckBTC to a halt, and I think the best course of action is to diversify by adding more potential new providers.
[/quote]

 @jan also addresses your other concern in his original post.

[quote="Jan, post:164, topic:18754"]
Moving forward the vision is to have multiple KYT providers and API key holders as well as multiple ckBTC variants, including non-KYT canisters controlled by the NNS.
[/quote]

As @bob11 explained previously, they have a 1 year subscription for the Chainanalysis KYT service.  Hence, there is no reason to believe that would fail in the next year.  During that time there will likely be more KYT provider and more API key holders added to the KYT canister.

[quote="bob11, post:336, topic:18754"]
you have to sign a 1-year contract up front for Chainalysis, so we’re essentially guaranteed a 1 year window already with an initial API key.
[/quote]

-------

If anyone is still confused about the proposal, then I highly recommend going back to [post 164](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ckbtc-and-kyt-compliance/18754/164) in this forum thread to read what @jan actually wrote.  Then you can focus on all the posts made by @bob11 because he selectively responded to a lot of good questions that needed clarification.  At that point you will be caught up without having to fuss too long with the rest of the drama that flooded this thread over the last 2 days.

@wpb , I truly appreciate your efforts on behalf of the community and was disturbed to see you attacked personally during the Treasury debate. I am sorry to see you now doing the same yourself, though admittedly in a much milder form.
The fundamental point is that we are in crypto mainly because of a set of principles. When those principles are compromised in the name of efficiency, my reaction is, well, what's the difference from fiat, then?
It is worth going to extraordinary lengths to ensure a system is decentralized, publicly auditable, and transparent. To begin with, ckBTC is inadequately decentralized (too few nodes and since nodes have no enforceable contracts and no stake in the future of ICP, a big incentive to collude and steal BTC once TVL is high enough. This is bound to happen, it is only a matter of time). 
Second, the mandatory addition of KYT makes the network beholden to US policies, which are opaque and often unfair. It would have been far better to add KYT as optional and keep the NNS free of US interference. Dfinity could have ensured KYT was available before the rollout in order to safeguard users without getting the NNS involved.
The reason the post about Toniq led to such an outpouring was because it was a bit like the straw that broke the camel's back. In and of itself it may seem minor. I could get on board the fact that anyone can start a KYT of their own, even though it probably won't pay for itself, and the more ckBTC KYT providers there are the more expensive it will be for each individual provider because queries get cheaper by volume. At least in principle it could get more decentralized over time.
It was the way in which all this was handled, and the fact that Dfinity pretends the NNS is already a functional democracy, so an NNS vote is a post-facto justification of any arbitrary decision, which stuck in my throat, because an NNS vote is currently like the last Russian election. Since everyone knows the vote is a foregone conclusion, the only way to affect anything is to change Dfinity's mind, which is why people are getting worked up on this forum.
You have a particular perspective, which is a valid one. Please allow that the opposing view is not just a case of jumping the gun after misreading Jan Camenisch's post, it is valid in its own right.

As a future improvement, I think the designated principle should add/update key only via a proposal, so that they cant just walk in and tamper with their key. Also if possible to display key expiry dates on a dashboard that would be a good thing for transparency.

stephenandrews | 2023-03-23 08:48:49 UTC | #362

Hey guys, I'm the Toniq CTO and co-founder, and I just wanted to comment on a few things here. Firstly, I understand where people are coming from. I'm a true believer in decentralized tech and try to push out against centralized barriers as much as I can. So lets get into it!

**Let's get ordinal, baby!**
When we decided to go down the Ordinals marketplace route, we knew we wanted to use some form of wrapped BTC. At this point, ckBTC wasn't a good solution for us; one reason was because public minting was not enabled. So at this stage, these were our options:

1) Fork ckBTC (lets call it wBTC for the purpose of this post)
2) Discuss with dfinity regarding timeframe of public minting for ckBTC (using ckBTC was our preference)

**What's the hold up? KY-whaT?**
We then reached out to dfinity to ask when public minting would be available, and found out that the issue was a concern around KYT (hence no public minting). We left this with dfinity and we removed ckBTC from our list of options because it did not seem viable. Due to the conversation, we did some research ourselves and were informed by our legal team that we would need to perform KYT as well. **What a bummer.**

So wBTC was our only option, but now we had to develop a KYT step. At this stage we thought we would be building the KYT element from scratch. These were our options:

1) Fork ckBTC, but develop a KYT step into the process
2) Build wBTC in motoko with KYT from scratch

**Good bye ckBTC, hello wBTC**
Forking ckBTC meant Rust, and we are mostly a Motoko dev shop so we would need to hire additional help. Building from scratch in Motoko was a big undertaking, so we were looking at both options. We also begun speaking with different KYT providers, reviewed API spec, and worked on what would be wBTC.

*At this stage we were not aware of the state of ckBTC with regards to KYT, or that being KYT provider was even an option, and there had been no communication about working with dfinity on ckBTC.*

**Back from the dead...?**
About 3 weeks ago, Bob and I jumped on a call with members of the ckBTC team. During this meeting they shared their progress with the KYT canister and the whole process of having KYT providers. It looked like they were close to having this complete, and they had already built support for ChainAnalysis (which was one of the KYT providers that we had shortlisted for wBTC). I personally didn't expect dfinity to be this close to having a complete solution.

Toniq as a KYT provider was used as a hypothetical of how it could work, but no commitment was made. Internally, we were still considering deploying our own wBTC due to a different issue we had with ckBTC which made it less viable for us. A few days later this forum post was created.

**To be, or not to be...**
Being a KYT provider for ckBTC meant we would need to use ChainAnalysis (as that's what the KYT canister supported), we would have to sign on to an annual contract and pay an upfront cost. dfinity had not found a KYT partner at this stage and would not go live without one. We decided that we would be in a position to be a KYT provider, and communicated this to dfinity. 

For us, this would mean we did not need to deal with developing and deploying our own fork, and could help to bring the OG ckBTC online for everyone to use. This was a few weeks ago, and within the last week we signed a contract with ChainAnalysis.

If we were not a KYT provider for ckBTC, or if ckBTC was to delay deployment, we would instead continue with our plans to deploy wBTC and blackhole the canister. We would plug our ChainAnalysis API key in, and we would work with other devs to integrate it with as many other projects as we could. We would ultimately be left with a fragmented ecosystem (two identical ckBTC instances, or just wBTC if no one came on board as a KYT provider).

**Now, I understand some of the arguments being said, so I thought I should clarify the following:**
1) **Are we making a profit from being a KYT provider?** No - fees charged would be to cover costs incurred by ChainAnalysis.
2) **Why are we doing it then?** Because we want an on-ICP BTC token for our marketplace, and we believe it would benefit other devs/services too
3) **Why don't we deploy your own fork?** We could, but we did not want to fragment the ecosystem
4) **Did we plot with dfinity in secret to be the sole KYT provider?** Not in my opinion. We found out about some information days before it was posted here, although I think it may have already been public via other channels (public dev meetings etc). We were not considering being a KYT provider until a few weeks ago and forking was a very real possibility for us.
5) **Can't we just remove our key and kill ckBTC?** If we removed our API key, ckBTC would function as it does right now. No one can wrap. I believe unwrapping is still available, and transfers will still work (as they do now). ckBTC would then be waiting for someone else to get an API key, and apply to inject it. We wouldn't be switching it off, just back to how it is right now (no public minting).
6) **Can't we selectively choose how to analyse each deposit (letting bad BTC in)?** No. We simply provide an API key. This key lets the KYT canister use our ChainAnalysis account to complete KYT. We have no control over the KYT process or outcome. This is like giving someone your credit card - I can't selectively decline payments, as payments come directly from my bank. I can take my credit card back off you though.

Sorry for the long post, but I hope this helps. Happy to answer any other questions too. 

On a side note, it wouldn't be hard to create (using Threshold ECDSA) an IC service that enabled swapping between ckBTC and BTC without KYT. LP's would be accepting the risk that they may receive tainted BTC in exchange for their clean ckBTC, but market forces may then set the price at a premium to compensate this. Users that did not want to go through the KYT process could then use this swap to exchange their BTC for ckBTC, which could then be used through the IC ecosystem. Just a thought.

Hopefully this is a misunderstanding due to interpretation of the translation.

KYT is a feature that is checked before wrapping into ckBTC. With or without implementation, CKBTC is still 1:1 to BTC.

WBTC is issued by depositing assets with Bitgo, which is completely different.

Toniq is a KYT provider, not a key depository like Bitgo.

I can't wait for the foundation and other members to submit their proposals, as I feel that further discussion will only add to the thread with content that is off topic.

Appreciate the long post Stephen 

Just a few points:

[quote="stephenandrews, post:362, topic:18754"]
No one can wrap
[/quote]

^This is a significant problem, a lot have diminished it as "Low significance" but ckBTC is a key defi product and not being able to wrap for a period can cost significant impact to a business on ICP depending on their model

Its a highly significant issue, albeit, I understand users assets are safe hence why its mentioned as low significance

Important to note, while the canister might be back to how it is now, it wont be the same for the people depending on it . The longer this is live, the more risk to projects that become dependant on ckXXX

[quote="stephenandrews, post:362, topic:18754"]

No - fees charged would be to cover costs incurred by ChainAnalysis.
[/quote]
I'm not sure you can say this? 

I've not been able to get what % a KYT provider would get per call to mint. We also dont know what volume you're basing your calculation on so till these happen, this claim has no basis 


Secondly, on the assumption that this is true, I don't understand how Dfinity is releasing this with intent of others onboarding since there is no incentive for them to do so? This part is the scariest of all since it removes the hope of this heading towards a more robust system 


Side Note:- 

I've reached out to a few Defi projects and they are discussing onboarding within the team. It sure would help if @Jan would make the fees to KYT providers public :tired_face:

[/quote]

There are so many different elements to this, from my understanding it's roughly ~$0.50c per screening, but with volume this may decrease. This would just be the KYT portion of the fee, I also believe an additional fee is taken to cover canister cycles cost which are used to fund cycles for the canister (and are not sent to KYT providers) - lets say this is another $0.50c. So if I send 1BTC from my wallet to be converted to ckBTC, I would receive 1BTC -  $1 fee.

However on subsequent deposits, KYT is cheaper (possibly free) within a period of time (weeks I think). So if you were to send another 1BTC, the fee may only be 50c to cover canister costs.

The KYT canister doesn't currently have a way to pay KYT providers yet, but I believe this will be added in future. So we are running this at a loss until the payout mechanism has been deployed. Ideally, we only want to be compensated for actual costs of KYT.

The best way forward is to continue developing the KYT canister to enable other 3rd party services as well (which may mean cheaper KYT costs), and to eventually develop a competitive fee mechanism to encourage other parties to provide this service too. 

One idea is that we could set a higher fee (lets say $1 for KYT per deposit where the cost is about 50c). We (as the initial KYT provider) are compensated at the end of the month for our actual costs incurred only - we are OK to run at cost during this initial expansion phase. The rest could sit in the KYT canister to assist future KYT providers in setting up (i.e. a **KYT setup fund**). 

In future, KYT providers can operate at a profit. This provides a duel incentive for new KYT providers - the KYT setup fund for initial setup, and the for profit aspect.

I believe you need to discuss with ChainAnalysis directly regarding fees and costs etc, arranging a demo. Although, you just need an API key (no actual dev work required), and then apply to have this injected as a KYT provider.

If dfinity were to wait for more KYT providers and delay ckBTC, this wouldn't really affect us at Toniq. We would likely go ahead with a fork as we've already signed on to an annual contract at this stage, and we're committing to getting some form of ckBTC working. But this leads to my comment about ckBTC potentially being stuck in limbo for much longer.

@Jan Considering how important KYT will be for the future of all ckXXX coins on ICP, is this something where resource is prioritized? 

or would we be moving onto sexier stuff? 

Considering we plan to have government and business services and the future releases reliant on KYT, it seems an apt place to direct resources

-------------------------

Berg | 2023-03-26 12:51:29 UTC | #371

So additional KYT providers wouldn't affect Toniq, but at the same time you've already signed a contract and will fork, instead of waiting for others to have an equal opportunity for "market share".

This train of thought borders on extortion and it's just leveraging your newly stated insider knowledge to your advantage.

Have you considered what will happen if the community boycotts your fork and nobody uses your WBTC? How much more material and reputational losses would you incur?

-------------------------

stephenandrews | 2023-03-23 10:59:49 UTC | #372

We have no advantage at this point - all the code is opensource. Anyone can fork ckBTC (which now has KYT included), sign up for a ChainAnalysis account, and have KYT compliant on-chain BTC canister. We were committed to either deploying a wBTC variant or using ckBTC for some time and either option can work for us.

We don't want to have market-share, if someone else wants to do this then that's awesome, I'll support it. We just want the feature to be live so we can build and deploy defi services. I know a lot of other developers are waiting for this as well.

If we deploy a fork now, continue to build our defi services, and no one uses wBTC, then that's how a decentralized service on the IC should be. If ckBTC then goes live later down the track and works well, than it would be super easy to switch over to it.

What's the alternative? Delay ckBTC, don't deploy a fork, and just wait? We want ckBTC to go live and work and be really robust in every way. If that means we have to wait months to get it right, then why would we not deploy an alternative in the mean time so we can still build and deliver defi services, and allow other teams and devs to do so too?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-23 11:18:22 UTC | #373

Maybe a dumb question here, but don't governments make these tainted utxos public? Is there a reason we aren't just hard coding the list? If new ones are added we make a proposal to add it?

We could set up a blacklist canister and add 21 community members/ic projects as voters in less than a day.

If we want further decentralization we can do an SNS and charge cycles to the query the blacklist to pay out to authenticators.  We don't even have to do a "sale". We could just airdrop to validated NNS neuron holders.

Second option has an n of a month probably and the first an n of days.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-23 11:28:56 UTC | #374

Looks like there isn't a super canonical list, but there is something like this:

![image|231x500](upload://dzPRXM2FjDEu7APtqL4fw9q2R3O.png)

As mentioned before though...there WILL be a lag and eventually flagged BYC will almost assuredly get into the utxo pool. I think we need to look at the architecture to figure out how to deal with those.  That seems like a much bigger problem.

Seems like the canister needs a utxo queue where we'd be able to push flagged utxos to the back of the queue in such a way that they would likely never come out.  If one does make it in then likely fees should increase until the amount is burned.  Or everyone is slashed...this would make diligent enforcement a network priority.

-------------------------

Your arguments are very logical. The fork route sounds like the best route, in my opinion.

Assuming a cost of 30000$ with a fee of 0.5$ per Mint 

After 60000 requests to mint, it would be pure profit

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-23 13:08:29 UTC | #378

Had a meeting with Chainalaysis regarding the cost of API access. Long story short the numbers don't add up for us. To get an idea.. if the fee was 50cents per TX then we would need roughly 60 txs everyday single day for a year to just break even. Every additional API key holder would dilute the available 'pool' of transaction fees reduce this profitability... meaning that we need an ever larger number of txs. 

So if Toniq and Saorsa Labs held keys (and a random selection design was implemented) we'd need 120 txs a day just to get to break even. This is based on initial costs however the price for API access also scales with the number of transactions sent so break-even is a moving target. 

There is the option of a community crowdfunded API Key however this would have to be done every year and people would need to trust someone not to run off with the money. 

I don't think opening the ICP Ecosystem to tainted BTC is really an option TBH... most people wouldn't want to own a stolen car, and the same is true with BTC. Institutions/ big money would also run a mile! 

It's a tricky situation.. unfortunately in the short term there probably isn't a better option. It leaves me uneasy though.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 13:12:05 UTC | #379

Increasing the fee or even making it a % of the conversion could make it more sustainable? Thoughts?

-------------------------

JxBrian | 2023-03-23 13:17:16 UTC | #380

The law of large numbers favors underlying principles. 1%of 100 might be a dollar $1. But when a business is transacting $1M, then the percentage doesn’t work for them as it is about $10K. Multiply that with 365 days and you’ll see why a large business would not want to be involved in such a model.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 13:23:39 UTC | #381

The other option is to just up the fee to 2$ or something

The fact that you had to go out of your way to contact chainalysis shows how bad leadership is at toniq. The do not have all their information open and public. However they are blackmailing the ecosystem that if they are not allowed to launch ckbtc then they would go ahead and make their own fork. I don’t see a problem with that as far as they don’t drag dfinity down a hole. Dfinity has been respectful and operates like an institution with high consideration of values. So if they don’t have all their information together then they really do not understand the market of KYT in and out. This makes them incompetent for reliance in future emergency occasions. All information regarding KYT issues should be at the least be available on their website and well documented.

-------------------------

This isn't wrong, to withhold info is not a sign of good faith or collaborative effort - especially for something where its considered "Not part of your profit or business scheme"

I have an idea 

what about the following model 

We set max fees at 5$ per mint

We can have a max of 10 KYT providers 

All KYT providers get 0.5$ each ?

To be fair to Toniq - I never contacted them to ask. Having spoken to them on various occasions I'm sure they would have told me the cost no issue. 

I dont think they are holding us hostage at all. My comments are not directed at them - just the process design. Process design/ build is mostly Dfinity's role in this. 

If it wasnt for Toniq we would be at a complete stand still. I do appreciate that! 

I feel like the options are

1, Completely park ckBTC.. possibility for months.
2, Go with an interim solution (Single entity API provider) BUT acknowledge that it is an INTERIM fix whilst other options are explored. 

I feel like we've probabily got to go with option 2 and be prepared to potentially manage some flak. 

Just my 2 cents..

-------------------------

NS01 | 2023-03-23 14:06:32 UTC | #386

Could be an option. We probably need to see what the real world demand is going to be. Not ideal but it would at least give some data to model.

Unfortunately no. There is a limit to the # of requests associated with a license (the limit gives you your cost per call). After you hit the limit, you are charged per call at the same price as overage charges.

So assuming a cost of $30k you might get 60k requests. But after 60k requests, you still pay $0.50 per call.

So after 60k requests to mint, you are still in the exact same scenario. $0.50 per call on top of what you have already paid. 

Like I said before, there is no scenario here where we profit off of this.

Now, if only we had an NNS-controlled Treasury
[/quote]

This! 

The problem is not that there is no developer who can implement a multiple agency KYT providers. 

It is that it is highly expensive and no single developer has that money lying around ready to put it into a canister project. 

However is some would fund the canister, at a potential profit of course then it might work. 

Or if like mentioned here, there was a NNS treasury then the NNS would fund such a project as it only helps a smooth transition between developers, the customers and concerned jurisdictions on ckbtc. 

Unless there is someone willing to fund this multi-KYT canister, then it would be long before we see the true potential of ckbtc.

Im just going to say it 

I cant put together fully whats going on here 

Bottom one is the current solution right? 

UTXOs are the bad wallets? 

You know... an automated proposal that goes to update UTXOs 2weeks to 1 month might not be such a bad idea - given compliance is ok with a "Delay in update"

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 14:40:45 UTC | #393

So wait 

You have to pay X$ (assume 30k$) up front, then ALSO pay .5$ per call?

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-23 14:42:23 UTC | #394

No sorry. Only if you go over the amount of requests you are allowed. The best way to think about it is you pay $0.50 per call forever. A set amount upfront, and the rest as they happen if you go over the amount you initially paid for.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 14:45:40 UTC | #395

Right... so you're essentially pre-buying a minimal amount of requests - then buying Adhoc

@bob11 @stephenandrews I'm a bit late to this topic but  I would support Toniq forking the ckBTC canister and doing their own wBTC. I think this would be a better approach for the network and would encourage other businesses to do the same. I might be in the minority but I don't think every service like this needs to be provided by the NNS. Also, it sounds like it is a financial burden/risk that should be addressed by each provider. Just my $.02

-------------------------

bob11 | 2023-03-23 14:50:18 UTC | #397

Definitely something we strongly considered. The risk here is how you control the canister. If you blackhole it, then you risk something going wrong and funds being trapped inside forever, which doesn't feel like a work-able solution to me. 

If not blackhole, it would need some kind of DAO control. Even WBTC on ETH is controlled by a 20-something multisig. 

The best option here is the NNS (which is why I like the Dfinity approach) but there are risks to this route as well. Anyone can put any canister under control of the NNS, but that doesn't mean changes to your canister code will pass an NNS vote.

Creating some kind of DAO from scratch is also possible, but hard to make it secure, decentralized, and properly incentivized.

I do believe a DAO would be the best solution here. Its seems like we have two good options with Axon and the SNS. The IC is almost purpose-built to support this sort of thing and I think if anyone can pull it off without DF's help it would be Toniq.

I agree that the NNS is a super appealing solution. However, I do question if this would still be the preferred approach if DF didn't direct such an overwhelming amount of liquid VP on non-governance topics. I'm going to avoid going down all of those rabbit holes; but, I do think its important to keep this in mind. If we want to set an example for future services I think at some point we need to stop using the NNS as a crutch. Especially when we're talking about a service that even DF admits is not considered a protocol-level service.

If we're going to settle on an imperfect solution I think I would prefer to start with a multi-sig solution that grows into a more decentralized DAO structure rather than put this on the NNS and hope for the best in the future.

I see your intent. But who would be the signers that you'd be comfortable with? I feel like it would be quite a challenge to find a set of signers that everybody is happy with.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2023-03-23 15:55:31 UTC | #400

With Axon you can set a low quorum and add any number of signers such that those interested in participating can do so.  You'd need to KYC to avoid sybils, but it is probably a decent short-term solution:


For example: Here is the BTB DAO.  I've kyc'd the people on the list so far as significant contributors to the IC ecosystem.  Right now I'm the only proposer, but the dao can vote to change that.

Manu | 2023-03-23 16:08:33 UTC | #401

Yeah I think my question is not so much technical, but really about how we'd come up with the list of people that together control ckBTC. It's a big responsibility, and everybody would need to be comfortable that this set of signers will take good care of ckBTC.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-23 16:39:32 UTC | #402

Before I try to respond I just want to make sure I understand the situation. Are you asking me how Toniq would choose the multi-sig participants for a Toniq wrapped BTC product, or are you asking me about choosing multi-sig participants for a product that is supposed to be considered the de facto wrapped BTC solution for the network?

All of my statements up to this point have been made with the understanding that this ckBTC canister is not a formal service provided by the protocol. If that’s no longer the case I would have to revise my statements.

-------------------------

theguy | 2023-03-23 16:45:17 UTC | #403

ckBTC is far too likely to be considered/viewed as the defacto BTC considering how things have gone down so far

-------------------------

Manu | 2023-03-23 16:58:31 UTC | #404

Ah, perhaps I misunderstood your statements. 

I had a broadly used ckBTC in mind, not a toniq product. I wouldn't say any version of ckBTC would have to be the de-facto standard, but of course its beneficial if many people use the same ckBTC (such that there is sufficient liquidity, and you don't need to convert between ckBTC1, ckBTC2, ckBTC3 for different dapps). To achieve that, we need a controller that is broadly trusted, which is why we proposed the NNS.

-------------------------

LightningLad91 | 2023-03-23 17:21:59 UTC | #405

Thanks for clarifying Manu. Apologies if my intent wasn't clear.

I agree, as a user this would be preferable. However, as an NNS stakeholder I do feel like trying to kickoff this behavior by putting ckBTC under NNS governance risks the credibility of the network. And that's a risk I take very seriously.

I'm also confident that we would eventually observe the behavior you described if we give independent orgs enough time on the market.
