Proposal - https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/123611

Sonic AMM (https://sonic.ooo) is a team building many popular dapps expanding the Defi horizon of IC Network, which includes Sonic Swap(https://app.sonic.ooo) and Sonic LBP (https://lbp.sonic.ooo)

**## Why are we creating a named neuron?** 
The driving force behind launching this neuron is to desire to contribute to the ongoing decentralization of the network, while also serving as a representative for the interests of the Internet Computer's retail and Sonic community. Despite having several well-known neurons already in operation, recent events underscore the need for an expanded roster - thus, we are stepping up to fill this role and inspire as many knowledgeable voters as we possibly can!

**What are the dApps under Sonic team?**

We have created several dApps in the IC ecosystem.

Meme Cake - A multi-chain NFT marketplace
Rocket - A crash game on ICP
Sonic AMM - DEX on ICP
Sonic LBP - Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool

**Named Neuron ID** - 10323780370508631162
