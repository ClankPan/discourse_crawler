I am loving the direction of the new asset canisters.

I wanted to point out though that the way the new asset canister build process is designed still seems to be very specific to Webpack. For context, I have been spending quite a few hours over the past couple days trying to get dfx build/dfx deploy to work with bundlers that are not Webpack. I have been experimenting with my own bundler [Zwitterion](https://github.com/lastmjs/zwitterion) and with [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) (both of which rely heavily on native ES modules and eschew traditional bundling to use the platform as much as feasible). Neither of them work out of the box, and I have been trying many workarounds but still have not gotten a full frontend up and running that can communicate with a canister.

I have opened a couple forum posts that will help, but I have a suggestion I think could really inform the dfx build process: When developing the build process, create non-trivial example projects using a variety of build techniques including Webpack, Parcel, Snowpack, no bundler, etc.
