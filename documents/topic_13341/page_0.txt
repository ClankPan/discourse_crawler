I have recently watched a talk about WebAssembly landscape in 2022.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ndu9qU_vY9c&t=638s
and Motoko was mentioned a specific language for Wasm along with [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) and [Grain](https://grain-lang.org/), both of them are a general purpose language that compiles into Wasm.
I was wondering if Motoko also can be compiled into wasm to be used for i.e the Web without the specifics of the internet computer and what does it take to create a program in Motoko to be used in a ordinary website?

Motoko is primarily designed to take advantage of the substrate provided by the Internet Computer (IC), i.e. employs the actor model and specific message passing, as well as the available system calls. That said, sequential code can be written (using `-wasi-system-api`) and our test suite uses this too.
