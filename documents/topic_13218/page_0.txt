These are really interesting articles I've recently found that get at the heart of what makes web3 so exciting. Both of them introduce primitives that can be used to design completely new types of applications IMO.

Curious what y'all think about them... (warning: these are not light reads)

* [Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763) (Vitalik is a co-author)
* [Attention Streams](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKA-K8YadRdgz-Qek01TUcCkRaI9CKCXGtJ31AbVWIU/edit#heading=h.cmz0xrgewpec) (author created BrightID)

I think the second article could inspire new ways we think about governance in the NNS.
