## Project highlights

Datanome is a decentralized data platform aimed at simplifying the buying, selling, and working with data. It is essentially a decentralized version of Snowflake with a simplified version of Deepnote on top.

## Web3 advantages

The project differs from Web2 initiatives by being decentralized, ensuring data protection, and enhancing data quality control. This decentralization is crucial as it automates data transactions and ownership, which is not feasible with centralized Web2 platforms.

## How is it built

Datanome employs a microservices architecture, using Motoko and Typescript. It integrates web applications, an object-relational model, and various layers (Identity, Transactional, DataOps, Semantic) for efficient data handling. 

## Internet Computer superpowers

The project leverages Internet Computer features for direct data processing, using its capabilities for efficient and secure operations, which are integral to the project's efficiency and security.

## Go-To-Market strategy

Initially focusing on the DeFi vertical, Datanome plans to establish partnerships and use specific channels for user attraction.

## Monetization

The project is profit-oriented, planning to use a decentralized governance model and a utility token for monetization.

## Status of the project

Currently, the foundational aspects of Datanome, like UI design and basic database/API layers, have been established and deployed on ICP.

## Resources

## Future Plans

Datanome's future plans include developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), seeking funding, and eventually launching a DAO for decentralized governance.

Thank you for the post! I think it is valuable to showcase how people can compute data on the IC which is unique compared to other blockchains. 

1. What data do people tend to post?

2. What is your positioning to open source data communities such as Kaggle? I think a lot of data scientists and analysts consider decentralization and open source.
