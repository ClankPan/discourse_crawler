Hello Community,

The Internet Computer is the first blockchain capable of hosting large amounts of data on the blockchain itself, using the memory of advanced “canister” smart contracts, in a significant leap forward. Another advance is that canister smart contracts can also service HTTP requests, and serve interactive web experiences directly to end-users. Together, this means that multimedia content can now be stored on a blockchain and served directly into web browsers. While these capabilities offers unprecedented experiences to be created on a blockchain, it also gives room to certain behaviors and practices that are at odds with the legality.

In a previous incident, copyrighted Nintendo game bios & ROMs were served by canister smarts contracts into web browsers, and Nintendo attempted to take action against the computers they could see serving the content.

The community had [discussed at length on](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-nodes-as-censors/9640) how such incidents should be handled since several approaches can be taken. A consensus was formed on [leveraging boundary nodes for content filtering](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/path-forward-on-leveraging-boundary-nodes-for-content-filtering/10911) to address incidents like the preceding Nintendo DMCA incident.

As DFINITY operates the ic0.app boundary nodes we have been actively working on outlining a [Code of Conduct for the ic0.app boundary nodes](https://dfinity.org/boundary-nodes/ic0-app/code-of-conduct/) operated by us. The Code of Conduct is designed to protect ic0.app boundary nodes from illegal activity. All users are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct at all times.

The long and short of it is:

* Don’t do anything illegal, inappropriate or abusive.
* Do respect yourself and the Internet Computer Community by keeping the Internet Computer a safe place for all users.
* Unacceptable content served via ic0.app nodes will be filtered at the sole discretion of the ic0.app boundary node operator.

Meanwhile, the process of decentralizing boundary nodes continues. Operators of boundary nodes will eventually be able to define their own policy and practices.

We are very pleased with the path forward described and feel it reflects both the concerns and innovations brought forth by the community. We thank you all for the productive discussion on this topic over the last few months. We have learned a lot from the community and we welcome any concerns or questions you may have. Please feel free to discuss in this forum thread.

Is there any update on Badlands? How many boundary nodes exist right now and where are they?

-------------------------

ld-dfn1 | 2022-05-12 20:19:21 UTC | #3

Hi CatPirate, 

Thanks for your question. At this time there are a total of 9 Boundary Nodes that are spread out in Amsterdam, Texas, France, Singapore, and California. Our goal is to have thousands of boundary nodes and the team is working very actively on enabling that. 

Badlands is a slightly longer-term roadmap initiative but the expansion of boundary nodes should happen much before Badlands.

Good question. This is a reference to ["Path forward on leveraging boundary nodes for content filtering"](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/path-forward-on-leveraging-boundary-nodes-for-content-filtering/10911) where the  community consensus was:

If we have an ICX proxy pointed at ic0.app, are we a “boundary node”? And if not will the content filtering be passed through the proxy so we have to filter it ourselves or will we get ic0.apps filtering?

The foundation obviously has 22% of the voting rights, why not vote on the "Code of Conduct" through NNS?

At present, although the fundation can decide the voting result, but that is what fundation deserve

In my opinion, the foundation violates the governance rights of stakers by doing so

[/quote]

With all due respect, I am not certain the full issue is clear based on this question.

It's the OPPOSITE actually. Foundation is not bypassing NNS, it is saying what the foundation will do with ITS machines so that they are legally compliant in their corresponding jurisdictions. It is not imposing anything on any machines. It is merely asserting how it will behave with its machines. Other boundary node providers may have other decisions based on their jurisdictions.

to quote the article:

[quote]
Having boundary nodes limit access to canisters, on a case-by-case basis, is seen as superior from a decentralization perspective to having node operators attempting to remove or freeze canisters by submitting proposals to the Network Nervous System (a special DAO that automates the management and governance of the Internet Computer blockchain network by the community).
[/quote]

This does not stop anyone from submitting NNS proposals to stop content, but it does allow each boundary node to fulfill its own prerogative (which they already were anyways). If a node was not legally compliant in a jurisdiction, the owner would likely shut it off.

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-12 23:01:48 UTC | #17

Since people already do what they wish with their machines, the next question then becomes "*how quickly can more people run boundary nodes?*" (so there can be more diversity of decisions).

That is the intent behind @catpirate's question and why Lomesh (VP of Growth at DFINITY) answered here:

Well, it looks like I have to live with it for now. But I hope everyone will not forget that we are going to rebuild the internet, NNS is the real controller, we need a new government, a new social system, and a new law

-------------------------

diegop | 2022-05-12 23:21:01 UTC | #19

I agree with you that new social systems will emerge from this public computing platform we are all creating. Patterns are still emerging.

Fwiw, one of the intent is simple: boundary node providers in a country should not be able to "be attacked" by uploading content to the IC that can have legal repercussions to the boundary nodes. Node owners currently have two choices when dealing with content that is legally liable in their jurisdiction (turn off node or ignore legal risks). 

This is one more reason why having a broad diversity of jurisdictions is important for the IC. What is legally liable in one country may not be legally liable in another.

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-05-12 23:29:31 UTC | #20

There is a distinct difference between the foundation and the network. The foundation is governed by the laws of Switzerland and exists to fulfill its mission filed with the governing authority. 

The network is a decentralized dao that has a mix of on chain and off chain governance. The network is progressing toward decentralization at a measured rate. To move faster than the underlying tech would be foolish. The network needs to walk a fine line of the already and not yet where it is both not centralized enough yet always decentralizing more. It cannot skip organic growth steps along the way or it will lose its anti-fragile properties.

The foundation can broadly commit to implementing the will of the network, but it can’t act in defiance of the rule of law.

There is little use in feigning outrage that the network has not reached a panacea or lamenting that we can’t jump up fully formed into a nakamoto paradise.

We are all riding this 🎢 together and we might as well enjoy the ride!

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-12 23:35:38 UTC | #21

I think we should not only rebuild the Internet but also rebuild the social order in the reconstructed Internet, which should be truly global.  I hope that as the IC develops, it will have a profound impact on real countries, and the best outcome is that the NNS and its affiliates become global governments.  The current review under national laws is only a temporary solution . Maybe the world will no longer have "nations"

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-12 23:39:28 UTC | #22

Humans cannot leave the Internet. If the Internet is really reconstructed, it is the reconstruction of human society

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-12 23:41:10 UTC | #23

NNS should take this into account at the beginning of its design. If NNS really has the right to manage the network, it should also have a good gov system

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-12 23:50:51 UTC | #25

I don't know if the foundation intends to design the network to be managed by national governments or directly by NNS

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-12 23:52:49 UTC | #26

If the NNS directly manages the network, the current governance mechanism is really bad.  It can be said that a blank test paper was handed in.

-------------------------

ysyms | 2022-05-13 00:04:20 UTC | #27

If it is to be governed by governments of various countries, then NNS and icp tokens are no longer needed. They will deprive governments of their jurisdiction and coinage rights. I believe that no government will allow ic to do so.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-05-13 08:24:36 UTC | #28

There are actually two meanings of decentralization of ICP: Internal decentralization and External decentralization.

Internal decentralization means decentralizing the voting power of the NNS.
External decentralization means decentralizing the powers of the governments around the world.

As for now, it seems that the IC community mainly focus on the internal decentralization of ICP, but in my opinion, what is more important in the long run is the external decentralization of ICP. On the other hand, the Bitcoin community mainly focus on the external decentralization, which, I think, may be called a Nakamoto Paradise.

So, the real question of (external) decentralization for ICP is: 
Will the Internet Computer still be fine even when all the governments around the world have united in banning it?
If the answer is no, then the NNS cannot be a real DAO and is just another accessory organization of the governments of some countries.

If someday a proposal is adopted by the NNS but all the governments around the world consider it to be illegal, then what will happen?

I understand that for now the Internet Computer may not have the ability to rebel against some powerful governments, but I hope that it will have the ability in the future. That is, I have a dream that one day the NNS will make us all live in a real "global village", and then what is legal or illegal can be totally determined by the voting system of the NNS.

If you take Moore's law to heart then we're probably 4-6years from current IC datacenter based hardware running on a raspberry pi like device.  When we have that a performant badlands is viable and the ability for a government to shut it down without turning off the internet would be difficult.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-05-13 22:41:13 UTC | #31

The Internet Computer is supposed to the blockchain of all blockchains. So there should be a difference.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-05-13 23:10:13 UTC | #32

That is really great. But I am afraid that many members of the IC community cannot fully recognize the importance of external decentralization of ICP. Some community leaders even want the Internet Computer to be in full compliance with the law of different countries, and I think they are going in a wrong direction. I hope that the Internet Computer will become the Metaverse and the NNS will be the supergovernment of the Metaverse.

[/quote]

The NNS is tuned to incentivize the best decisions possible for the health of a decentralized computer network. There is nothing it tuned to ensure human rights, provide for the common defense, ensure tranquility, etc, etc.  That computer network can host any number of other right-sized and specialized networks that *could* be tuned to do those things. Human society thrives through the specialization of labor and governance will thrive when we have specialization of governance. I'd be wary of putting too many eggs in the NNS basket.

There's no blockchain or any other platform that will ever survive "every government in the world uniting to ban it".

I can see partly what concerns you. Maybe you just want the Internet Computer to become an advanced version of the Internet. But if so, the Internet Computer might fail in the same way as the Internet: today, a totalitarian government can easily build a "Wall" to restrict the freedom of internet users, and some governments even want to shut the Internet down. The NNS version of supergovenment can be essentially different from all the governments that have ever practiced throughout human history: it is a government of everyone (whoever you are and wherever you come from) all over the world, and it is realized through advanced blockchain technology, not through physical violence.

-------------------------

kusiyo | 2022-05-14 00:03:03 UTC | #36

I don't think you can be sure of that. In fact, if everyone wants it, then the governments cannot stop anything. So, the real question is how many and how much people want it.

-------------------------

kvic | 2022-05-14 19:24:32 UTC | #37

Seems you have forgotten history. 
Thinking that you are going to take over the world is the start of the Dot-com Bubble.

We are seeing the same repeating history of excessive speculation of Crypto with massive growth and adoption that will bring many to ruin.  

Most of the coins out there, in my opinion, have little in the way of an idea other than they can.

Many just want to pump and dump for massive gains. 

This history has repeated itself in the past with transport, electronics and many other major changes in history.

If history does repeat then investors will get tired of the BS and lies and pull out and then from the ashes will raise the real coins that will survive.

ICP or NNS is just a new technology that delivers internet services around the world. What and how that is used is determined by the builder that creates their ideas upon it.

I think this subject is about boundary nodes, respecting the laws of others and their countries to avoid incidents and the policy changes needed.

Some of us have very strong views but for us to survive the coming history correction in crypto the community will have a say with a more even handed approach.

I'm not sure what this means. I thought ic0.app boundary nodes run `icx-proxy` processes themselves, which then translate HTTP calls to IC calls. How would you point your own `icx-proxy` to a boundary node?

-------------------------

skilesare | 2022-05-15 12:23:35 UTC | #40

When you start icx proxy you give it a host. I think we give it ic0.app. I’m trying to figure out if that means we are using a boundary node as a gateway or communicating with the core infrastructure and bypassing the boundary nodes.

Hi Folks,

Based on the replies and questions on this thread, we (DFINITY) thought we would share some clarity regarding the edge infrastructure of the IC (boundary nodes). We thought we'd share the vision/design and compare with the state of the world to see the gaps.

## The Vision

The vision and design intent for boundary nodes is:

* **Boundary nodes aid in canister discoverability and scale query call performance**.
* **Boundary nodes can perform content filtering** - Based on discussions with the community, the design intent is that the IC should also [use boundary nodes for content filtering](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/path-forward-on-leveraging-boundary-nodes-for-content-filtering/10911), an idea that came from the community, not DFINITY. Without going into the whole design rationale (you can click on the link and read more), some folks on this thread mentioned that this design decision was not formalized via an NNS Motion proposal. We think that is a reasonable ask and will submit an NNS motion proposal for this.
* **Boundary nodes are run by many entities** - Very importantly, the vision is that many entities run many boundary nodes and that boundary node deployment be managed by the NNS, similarly to replica nodes today.

## The State of the World

As of writing this post, there is a gap between vision and implementation.

* Boundary nodes do help with canister discoverability
* Boundary nodes can and do filter content so they can stay online in their jurisdictions
* Boundary nodes are NOT yet run by many different entities.

At high level, the main reason that boundary nodes are not yet run by many entities is organizational focus. I will explain in simple terms:

1. Boundary Nodes need TLS certificates to establish a secure connection with users’ browsers.
2. To do this in a decentralized (many entities) and secure way, IC needs to have tailored Multiparty computation (MPC) for efficient TLS session establishment, which does not exist today and is a very complex piece of cryptography that will take time to develop.
3. The researchers and engineers at DFINITY who are scheduled to work on this are currently f**ocused on finishing Threshold ECDSA and Bitcoin integration** which needs to be finished first.

Our belief is that once these big projects are shipped, we can focus on MPC for TLS.

I realize I stayed high level, but that should give folks in the community the understanding through the mountain of details and facts

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-05-17 01:00:00 UTC | #42

> Boundary nodes aid in canister discoverability and scale query call performance

Do you mind clarifying this point? My understanding was that boundary nodes were the only way to "discover" (or otherwise talk to) canisters. I wasn't aware that it was possible to directly call replicas without going through a boundary node.

-------------------------

cryptoschindler | 2022-05-25 12:15:21 UTC | #43

I was wondering the same, can I talk to the replicas directly without going through the API offered by boundary nodes and can I then setup my own boundary node right now?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2022-10-01 05:30:13 UTC | #44

According to the Sept Global R&D presentation, the service worker can communicate directly with replicas, without going through the boundary node:

![Screen Shot 2022-09-30 at 10.29.22 PM|690x390](upload://dFmYDrDdzJmDgsJeAOctBKcazgI.jpeg)

Can someone confirm if that's true? If so, can other clients (like what @cryptoschindler suggested) also talk directly with IC replicas?

-------------------------

domwoe | 2022-10-01 10:58:08 UTC | #45

This is a simplified illustration. The service worker still communicates with the boundary node and the boundary node forwards the request to a replica in the specific subnet.

-------------------------
