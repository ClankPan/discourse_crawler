I recently installed Fedora 36 on my laptop cause I found myself working 90% of the time using wsl2, which has its own set of issues and decided to make the switch.
Despite having a fingerprint scanner and setting it up in Fedora I can't use it when logging in with Internet Identity, I'm only give the option to use a security key or scan a QR code with a phone. Am I doing something wrong or isn't II compatible with Linux systems yet.

I am pretty sure you can make it work if you recompile the kernel :) 
Jokes aside, maybe look for an additional package, keywords: webauthn, biometric authentication, keychain

I did try, but searching "linux webauthn" doesn't return many results, I also remember reading a while back the only way to use II on Linux was with a ledger or Yubikey, not sure if anything changed since then.

Have you tried this blog? - https://blog.hansenpartnership.com/webauthn-in-linux-with-a-tpm-via-the-hid-gadget/

I haven't tried it myself, but skimmed through the text and most of it makes sense, it seems to solve your problem. Obviously you'd need to guarantee physical security & stuff, so take care.

Hello,
My experience with webauthn is that not all browsers are on the same level. I use a key not a reader (on Manjaro) and the result is that Brave works best.

Hope that help

You can test your webauthn setup on this page, for instance: https://webauthn.io

My guess is that webauthn with biometrics may not work on Linux, but probably with a Yubikey or similar it would. But that's really just a guess.

I read it but honestly was hoping for a more straightforward solution, it seems absurd such a basic feature is available on all OSs except desktop linux: https://webauthn.me/browser-support.

Well, the beauty of linux is that it's open source. Most of the software available on linux has been written because someone felt it's absurd not to have such a basic feature ;) Be the change you want to see in the world, and all that jazz.
