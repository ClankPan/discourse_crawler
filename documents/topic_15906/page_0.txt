I remember I saw a remote ledger canister way of installing a ledger canister. Does anyone have an example?

I'm not quite sure what you want to do. The general way to get ledger to work locally is to go through this tutorial: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/ledger/ledger-local-setup

In case you're talking about the remote canister feature in dfx, the ledger canister definition would look like this:
```
    "ledger": {
      "type": "custom",
      "candid": "ledger.public.did",
      "wasm": "ledger.wasm",
      "remote": {
        "candid": "ledger.public.did",
        "id": {
          "ic": "ryjl3-tyaaa-aaaaa-aaaba-cai"
        }
      }
    }
```
