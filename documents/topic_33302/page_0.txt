How to convert a frontend canister to `.wasm` file?

After `dfx deploy package_manager_frontend` I can't find a `.wasm` file for this module.

dfx unpacks the canister wasm to `.dfx/local/canisters/<canister name>/assetstorage.wasm.gz`. You can also directly get it from https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/tree/master/src/distributed
