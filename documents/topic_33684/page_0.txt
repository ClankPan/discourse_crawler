Hi guys, I'm just wondering, in proposal 131426 it says, that the mu1 data center will be decomissioned. 
A couple months back the Technical University of Munich became node provider, does this mean, their node machines are also gone/replaced? 

Thanks in advance :slight_smile:

Those proposals refer to the mu1 nodes owned by Staking Facilities.
