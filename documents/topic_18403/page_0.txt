When I `dfx start`, I get the following output:

```
...
Dashboard: http://localhost:50383/_/dashboard
```

So my first assumption was that the replica was being served on `:50383`, although I was then confused by `/_/dashboard`. Since `/_/dashboard` appears nowhere in the [spec](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ic-interface-spec#http-interface), I assumed it was some other process that bound on that port to provide extra info. Visiting the address, I see the following:

```
Http Server Config
Config { listen_addr: 127.0.0.1:0, port_file_path: ... }
```
which suggests that the replica just binds to `0` and then reports the port it was assigned. Unfortunately for me, if `port_file_path` was ever written, it was gone by the time I tried reading it.

I then turned to OS tools, and discovered that 4 different ports were bound:

```
$ sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P
...
replica   21209 nicolas   43u  IPv4 0x49f94277d571ae23      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:50381 (LISTEN)
replica   21209 nicolas   44u  IPv4 0x49f94277d57197e3      0t0  TCP *:50382 (LISTEN)
replica   21209 nicolas   45u  IPv6 0x49f94277d56a5afb      0t0  TCP *:50383 (LISTEN)
icx-proxy 21211 nicolas    9u  IPv4 0x49f94277d571cf83      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:4943 (LISTEN)
```

It looks like only `50383` is actually the replica, since it's the only one that actually output some status (as per the spec):

```
~$ curl 127.0.0.1:50381/api/v2/status
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
~$ curl 127.0.0.1:50382/api/v2/status
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
~$ curl 127.0.0.1:50383/api/v2/status
+��|ic_api_versionf0.18.0hroot_keyX�0��0...
```

Couple questions:

* What is this `/_/dashboard`, and is that served by the replica itself? If so, where (ideally in the spec) can I read more about it?
* What are the other two "replica" ports `50381` and `50382`?

`/_/dashboard` is a human readable debug endpoint, it's not part of the spec. It produces an HTML dashboard displaying stuff like the replica version and subnet type; and listing all canisters. There's also `/_/pprof` next to it, which allows you to collect replica CPU profiles in real time.

On the same port, as you already discovered, you get the `/api` endpoints, described in the IC spec.

The other two ports, if I had to guess, are the metrics endpoint (also HTTP, produces replica metrics in the text format accepted by Prometheus); and the P2P endpoint (not HTTP, look in the IC repository under `/rs/transport` if you're curious).

FYI, probably the most convenient way of figuring out the replica port (to send api calls to) is to run `dfx info replica-port`.
