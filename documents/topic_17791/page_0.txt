Firstly, I do think ICP has the potential to be a top 5 coin in market cap, however, being exposed financially to this project has allowed me to understand it better and why it's flawed and why I should put my money elsewhere.

I'll begin with what's good about the Internet Computer, in my opinion;

1) Asynchronous smart contract communication
This is what distinguishes ICP from other networks, it's a completely unique take on what smart contracts can be and opens up possibilities not possible with networks that host a single monolithic state machine

2) (high) Node hardware requirements
Another unique(ish) idea that I like, the internet is run on servers, not desktop computers, and having high node requirements opens up more possibilities for applications

In my opinion these are the two key selling points for the IC over other networks however, sadly, they are not implemented in a way that is congruent with the crypto ethos. I'll explain why.

**The network is not decentralized, or scalable**

What do I mean when I propose the network is not decentralized? I'm not talking about the number of nodes or node providers, I'm referring to the central point of control that is the NNS and the role it plays. **Democracy is not decentralization.** The NNS has control over literally every aspect of the network, and without it, the network **cannot** function. This is in contrast to governance in other crypto projects, where users vote to make changes to very specifically designed aspects of a project that simply cannot be automated otherwise. 

The NNS has control over the entire topology of the network, meaning subnets are not created or load balanced at the protocol level, spawning new ones when all others are at max capacity, it is simply DFINITY picking from a pool of nodes to spawn a new subnet. Again there is plans for DFINITY to secede and let the enthusiasts(?) manage these things but again **Democracy is not decentralization.** 

This leads into why I stated that asynchronous smart contracts are not well implemented. [This thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-about-icps-subnet-design/14464/) goes into more detail as to why the subnet model hinders this core aspect of the ICs design. TL:DR? Subnets only make sense for synchronous state machines, putting asynchronously communicating cannisters together in a centrally controlled & designed subnet means that developers are limited in the kinds of network topology that will be running their app. This is in contrast to Avalanche's subnet model where the Dapp developer has control over the subnet's creation, it's rules for gas, and whether node joining is permissioned or permissionless.

The second point is that the network is not scalable. You might think this is untrue based on DFINITYs marketing, however think about what scalability is; it's the ability to increase **and decrease** in throughput. With node rewards on the IC, nodes are minted a fixed amount of dollars worth of ICP regardless of the amount of transactions they process, this means the network **requires** constant growth as node rewards increasingly debase ICP the bigger the network becomes. The network cannot scale downwards from a point of massive expansion without breaking into a death spiral as noted by some people on this forum. This also means to prevent a death spiral in the event of the network expanding then contracting the NNS would have to delete various subnets and remove nodes from the network and the cannisters they host to prevent a death spiral. This is a fragile system.

This is in contrast to **every other blockchain network** which can expand and contract dynamically depending on demand, which is in my opinion one of the most impressive aspects of blockchain networks, that they are anti-fragile (at least the good ones are).

My final point is that DFINITY views the IC as a commercial product and not a sovereign network like the Ethereum Foundation views Ethereum. This is of course my most subjective opinion, but I do feel strongly that this is the case.

Fair enough. I do want to understand one thing about your meaning of decentralization. Won't the number of node providers increase with time?

Actually, the plan from the engineering side is to (eventually) implement dynamic load balancing. But in order for that to work at all, you need to be able to migrate canisters. Which is why we're working on subnet splitting and will then move on to subnet merging (because we've determined this to be the simplest way of implementing canister migration).

It is not a straightforward proposition, though (imagine moving running processes with open sockets from one VM to another, if you will; while being able to verify that no tampering has occurred in the process). Which is why it will take some time to complete. We do have an almost working implementation for the subnet splitting (including message rerouting), we just need to figure out the orchestration, including the verification part.

The plan is that eventually one should be able to decide what sort of properties the subnet they want their canister to run on should have. From something as simple as "I want my canister to run on a fiduciary subnet" (a subnet with higher replication and tamper resistance) to "a subnet consisting of EU replicas only" or "low compute, high storage". Automation (a la Kubernetes) should be able to then take care of which canister runs where, ensuring all these constraints are respected.

The other concept I've heard discussed (within and without DFINITY) is subnet rental. If you plan on building a large dapp; or a small one with very specific requirements that can't be met by simply specifying constraints; you should be able to say "put me together a subnet consisting of these nodes and give me sole control over what runs on it".

None of the above involve any sort of democracy. Nor would it be feasible for the NNS to directly and manually manage anything more than a few dozen subnets and a few hundred nodes.

All of the above though requires at the very least solid support for canister migration; a subnet/canister management system similar to Kubernetes; and implementing a much more elaborate cost model than simply "cost per replica". And it's not that anyone has anything against any of the above (as far as I know), it's just that all of it needs to be built.

Problem is as @Kurtis0108 said the network isn't quite capable of scaling based on actual usage, it can grow but downsizing is much more iffy as it would mean kicking providers out of the network after they invested lots of money and time to get approved, which in turn might disincentivize new potential providers from considering running nodes on the IC. As more subnet types are created the network's topology gets more fragmented and the scaling issue becomes worse.

-------------------------

I am not going to get involved in an argument regarding whether the network can scale down (AFAICT most blockchains can't even scale; and for those that can, what would scaling down mean? reducing the number of validators on a side-chain down to single digits?). Or whether the tokenomics appear to require continuous network growth to avoid inflation. Or whether inflation needs to be avoided at all costs.

But I will point out that from a technical POV, most of the subnet constraints that one would be able to specify would refer to stuff like network topology (e.g. high or low number of replicas; high block size and low block rate; all replicas under some legal jurisdiction; or in a single data center, so as to achieve the lowest latency possible; etc.). It would not be about specific hardware configurations, as in "high CPU, low storage"; or the other way around. And the latter could, for the most part, be achieved by having e.g. a high CPU, low storage replica share the same hardware with a low CPU, high storage replica.

While one may argue about intangible aspects such as whether the tokenomics allow for the network to scale down; or what would providers do in such a situation (e.g. sell their hardware at a discount?); both these aspects and the technical ones can be addressed AFAICT. None of it is set in stone.

There is nothing in the protocol that says node providers must be rewarded after such and such a model. It's just the way thing stand now. And that's a combination of what was required to pull in node providers to launch the network; the current limitations of the implementation (e.g. no real loadbalancing support); and some amount of inertia from all parties involved.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-04 20:00:04 UTC | #6

@free 
You raised some good things and I read all you wrote but they are very granular, instead of replying to individual points I'll reply with what would make me reinvest in ICP.

This isn't necessarily what *I want* it's what I think what would beat ICP if someone else did this.

**Get rid of the NNS as something that controls the network, by making the protocol much more minimalistic.**

The only role for the network should be to connect developers who want to pay for replicated computation (or unreplicated), with nodes who want to run computation for money. If you take a step back and think about this, you realize this kind of network can be done with as little as a messaging system and a global currency, it doesn't require an intermediary layer of subnets or a protocol determining how nodes *ought* to be organized and it doesn't require governance. 

The users and nodes should determine the topology such that the network itself reflects the incentives inside the network. What do I mean by this? Smart contracts are essentially replicated compute jobs, developers ought to be able to bid ICP for nodes to replicate their smart contract according to the spec they configured and the amount of ICP they post. This kind of system is a free market, the most decentralized, scalable, anti-fragile system humans know of, and I mean that quite literally.

Put this in contrast to ICP, which more closely resembles central planning reminiscent of communism. This kind of system does not work at large scale and has inefficiency and fragility baked into it.

EDIT/Addendum: A federated system would also work well too, instead of the example I gave, where users bid for compute jobs. A federated system would mean nodes themselves associating with each other and determining the structure of the network, such that they form federations where developers can deploy smart contracts to if they agree to the federations rules/requirements.

How would the nodes coordinate what computation to replicate without a consensus protocol?

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-04 20:19:13 UTC | #8

@JaMarco 
I should've wrote that as "as long as you have a system where nodes and users can communicate arbitrary data and transfer tokens, you don't need to prescribe the compute environment (subnets) like the current system does"

Communication and token transfer obviously needs to go through a consensus protocol to work

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-01-04 20:48:04 UTC | #9

How does that scale without subnets? This one network will have to process all dev and user activity, what do you envision the throughput is?

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-04 21:06:26 UTC | #10

Subnets are a way to scale it, subnets do not need to be at the protocol level to scale it, my point was to demonstrate what is absolutely necessary at the protocol level versus what is prescribed by the network. I believe any system that aims to be maximally extensible will win versus one that tries to maximally useful, because one cannot predict what people will find useful in the future. ICP & DFINITY prescribe way too much on the protocol level such that I believe it'll be beat out by more extensible solutions if another team make them.

[This thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/question-about-icps-subnet-design/14464/) explains what he means, instead of having fixed subnets the protocol decides which nodes will run the canisters based on dev specified parameters: location, replication, etc...

And that's just one other way to do asynchronous smart contracts,

A federated system would mean nodes themselves associating with each other and determining the structure of the network, such that they form federations where developers can deploy smart contracts to if they agree to the federations rules/requirements.

(From my previous post in this thread) 

And all of these systems **don't even need to be on the protocol level** if it was designed from the ground up to be maximally extensible for everyone, you could have the current subnet model, as well as these two models that I have proposed operating on the same network, all created by developers or DFINITY at the application level, instead they chose to do more work to create an overall less useful system

[/quote]

We aren't talking about scaling throughput but scaling the network as in the actual hardware running it, other chains have a much simpler and more fluid model that is known beforehand so the miners/validators know what they get into: there is a fixed issuance + network fees, if both aren't enough then the node owners can either keep their hw on at a loss as an investment or back out. 

On the IC providers are promised and expect fixed monthly rewards, that by itself creates many potential issues such as continuous growth needed to avoid inflation as you mentioned but also raises the question of what should be done with those nodes when in extreme cases network usage spikes and then is drastically reduced, e.g after a bull market.
Sure there is nothing that stops the NNS from changing how the current system works to solve such scenarios were they to arise on day, but: 
1) They have barely if at all been discussed, which doesn't inspire confidence.
2) They'd most likely result in tokenomics changes or kicking providers and we go back to my initial point of new potential providers being disincentivized from considering running nodes on the IC.

On their own they might not be a problem but once you start mixing them together, e.g low repl subnets with low block rate and nodes run in X country it becomes trickier to make sure the protocol's computational capability is constantly being used as cost efficiently as possible and stuff like running  a canister on an arbitrary number of nodes won't be feasible without subnet rental, which is extremely costly. The subnet model forces every possible permutation of those options to be its own subnet with nodes dedicated only to it, so a tradeoff has to be made between customizability and cost efficiency.

I am struggling to understand alternatives to the NNS that would allow for a protocol as complex as the IC to be seamlessly upgraded across all hardware providers.

That's what's so beautiful about the IC, it brings together hardware providers and weaves them into the protocol. AWS and other clouds work the same way, they unilaterally control the provisioning of their own protocol across all of their hardware...well, or at least they give developers the option to spin these up.

I would love to brainstorm how to remove the centralization risks of the NNS while not losing its most important benefits.

Decentralized systems are flat, there is no top-down control. Even though they technically allow centralized systems inside them. A system that presides over the entire network (The NNS) cannot ever be decentralized, regardless of if its democratic or despotic.

I like simplicity not complexity, complexity just means, there's more stuff that can go wrong, especially in dynamic systems. If the NNS was confined to software upgrades then that's a much more bulletproof system, but that's not DFINITYs goal.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2023-01-05 23:11:45 UTC | #21

Can you elaborate more on what you mean by "If the NNS was confined to software upgrades"? Software upgrades would still facilitate changing essentially anything about the protocol, at least technically speaking.

Are you suggesting that confining NNS proposals to replica binary upgrades would solve many of the problems you're concerned with? Basically that would just take away the ease of changing many of the things that the NNS can change.

Also of course complexity is not desirable, but the IC is complex and the NNS provides a simple means to upgrade it.

> Can you elaborate more on what you mean by “If the NNS was confined to software upgrades”? Software upgrades would still facilitate changing essentially anything about the protocol, at least technically speaking.

As in, the NNS's only purpose being to negate the need for hard forks when something absolutely needed to be changed at the protocol level.

> Are you suggesting that confining NNS proposals to replica binary upgrades would solve many of the problems you’re concerned with? Basically that would just take away the ease of changing many of the things that the NNS can change.

Doing so would mean that the network is at least uncensorable, it would also require deep thought and design by DFINITY such that every system the network is composed of is carefully thought out because it's not expected that the network can be rapidly changed and iterated upon. 

Would I reinvest if that was the case? Probably not, I think the blockchain networks going to win out are the ones who design their entire network around a specific aspect of the stack like data storage, computation, customizable node topologies and virtual machines, etc. I'm not gonna do anything shilling on this forum but I think that's the narrative that will play out. Which ties into my previous recommendation for DFINITY to make the protocol much more minimalistic, and get rid of the NNS. (This doesn't mean do a complete 180, just release the "killer feature" as a side feature to the current network and then progressively direct development into making that the main system)

We should explore all valid criticisms, and if getting rid of the NNS would benefit the protocol then it should be done.

I'm not decided that's the right path, but I understand the great negatives that the NNS brings. It also brings positives.

Not sure we've taken the right trade-offs, thus we need to explore solutions to these potentially existential problems.

I don't understand why simplicity should be a value over all others. Our goal should be to make systems as simple as possible *while retaining their specific features and advantages*. 
Bacteria are simpler than humans, and will certainly survive on the planet longer than humans. Many more things can go wrong in humans than in bacteria. But we cannot change humans to be as simple as bacteria. 
The IC's complexity brings advantages and those should be taken into account in any plan to simplify it. It is precisely these trade-offs that make a multi-chain world inevitable.
You might be correct in predicting that lean, specialised chains are the way forward rather than omnibus behemoths like the IC. We shall know in a couple of years how that plays out.

Basically the ultimate power that it yields, in the hands of a small few right now. It will always be in control of everything, and I think that leads to great censorship and possibly legal and regulatory risks that might otherwise not be an issue if control were truly relinquished. For example, the NNS controlling ICP could lead to sanctions and money transmission issues, but if ICP were truly autonomous then the NNS may not be liable. I'm not sure on this, just an example. The NNS is in many ways operating as a DAO, and we're learning about the liability of DAOs.

I see the NNS as one of the great liabilities of the IC. It also has positives that are quite fantastic, like seamless protocol upgrades that have allowed us to move very quickly.

NNS doesn't really have ultimate power, the social consensus of the nodes operators do (just like any other blockchain). Nodes could collectively just decide to install a client software update that reverses anything the NNS does or just delete the NNS entirely.

I think that's pretty unrealistic and does not describe the reality of how node operators work on the IC.

Obviously it’s a safety precaution!

That would come with some things you might not understand at the current time. Or agree with? 

But your concerns are valid, that is why there are proposals to manage and change the trajectory of NNS functionality as needed. But you have to be patient and follow due process in making the necessary changes. 

Again, I haven’t seen or heard anything bad about the NNS that cannot be fixed in a diplomatic way.

JaMarco | 2023-01-06 22:38:16 UTC | #34

It's not about it being realistic, it's that it's possible and would be relatively easy for them to do if they wanted to. The "network" is whatever the majority of nodes says it is. If 99.9% of ICs nodes installed an update to delete the NNS, then that's what the network is now (an IC with no NNS). The .1% of nodes that refused to install the update have no power because they don't have the nodes to do anything (provide security, store tons of state, serve requests at scale, etc...).

Yes the nodes are setup to listen to the NNS automatically, but that's my point, the NNS is just a social consensus convenience mechanism. It automates software upgrades and allows anyone who is willing to buy/stake tokens to participate (potentially making it more decentralized than just nodes making all decisions). Honestly the IC is just ahead of the curve on governance DAOs, some of the other higher performance PoS L1s already have them (Polkadot, Cosmos, Tezos, Cardano is planning one). I think the only reason Eth doesn't have one is because it isn't technically capable.

Every blockchain network is ultimately governed by the social consensus of its nodes. What's the difference between the NNS and Lido DAO+Coinbase+1 other entity having the majority of validators and stake to change anything about Ethereum or Solana validators making all the decisions about their network on Discord? NNS is just a better and more robust way to go about it.

the simplest system is a system that has been turned off. if the complexity is actually leading to a problem start by identifying how.

I'm saying that this is nearly the opposite of the current situation.

The reality seems to be that the node operators have two choices: follow the automatic updates from the NNS or don't participate in the IC. This is due IMO to a combination of the complexity of the protocol software itself, the safeguards and automation placed around the node upgrade process, and the DFINITY licensing.

> Who is ultimately making/enforcing this rule? It’s not the NNS, it’s Dfinity.

I'm pretty sure it's enforced by the Internet Computer Protocol... using a bunch of cryptography, I presume. If you're a registered node provider and want to receive node provider rewards, you need to upgrade as the NNS dictates. The NNS (through the Protocol) has code to enforce this, I believe.

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2023-01-07 03:29:01 UTC | #42

I feel like it's worth pointing out that the NNS is not some normal organization... it's a DAO (obviously, but might not be as obvious).

The IC is a hybrid permissioned blockchain, where subnets (i.e. individual blockchains) are configured and controlled by a DAO. I say "hybrid" because a DAO is not a single person or company, and while power is indeed centralized in a single "thing" it's a thing that is currently structured as a direct democracy so that power is distributed across token holders. The power of the U.S., for example, is also centralized in a single government, but that government's power is distributed across voters...

As OP points out, other blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are indeed fully permissionless, where any node can join or leave at will.

So why did the IC choose a hybrid permissioned model? Because it enables massive efficiency and unlimited scale, as well as features like HTTPS outcalls and Threshold Cryptography, which would simply be impossible if you have thousands of nodes participating in consensus.

You're right, the correct word was hardforks. My point was the node operators really control the network, not the NNS.

And what if all the node operators delete the old IC client and install a new one with a modified IC protocol without the NNS?

-------------------------

jzxchiang | 2023-01-07 04:01:45 UTC | #44

Then they wouldn't be able to discover and communicate with each other, and they also wouldn't get paid with ICP.

-------------------------

JaMarco | 2023-01-07 04:09:24 UTC | #45

If they all installed the same mod why wouldn't they be able to communicate with each other and get paid with ICP?

BTW this has happened before, soon after Genesis the NNS broke and couldn't update the network anymore. Dfinity had to give all the node operators an IC client update to manually install to fix the NNS.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-07 04:25:16 UTC | #46

Do you think the NNS, and by extension the token holders, ought to be the ones orchestrating subnets? I think the closer you get to a system where the structure of the network is determined by node/user interaction under a "code is law" paradigm, and not a central party the better. A closer system like this would be Avalanche where any user can create a subnet with it's own native currency that gets payed to nodes to incentivise them to validate that subnet. (No I don't own AVAX)

I think members of this community should press DFINITY and ask themselves these two questions
1) What do you think the ultimate role for NNS is, when the network is in it's final state (no more dev action by DFINITY)
2) What do you think the ultimate dynamic is for coordination between nodes and users (will nodes always be solely coordinated by NNS governance, will users be able to coordinate nodes themselves in some kind of "marketplace for computation", or will nodes be able to coordinate themselves without any kind of central party involved, etc)

Yes, for any high performance subnet, which would be almost every subnet on the IC. The NNS is a necessary internal control and approval filter to maintain that high performance. If you have any ideas about how to run an entire IT stack at web speed with enterprise-scale applications and blockchain encryption on grandma's 10-year old cell phone or laptop with spotty WiFi while she is watching cat videos, then feel free to walk us through how that decentralized, permissionless subnet might work.

The IC is not just keeping track of cumulative balances on a 4-5 column spreadsheet table like almost every other blockchain. The entire IT stack is running on the IC blockchain. This requires extremely high (and consistent) hardware / network standards in order to run at web speed and to be able to audit for suspicious consensus deviations from the norm. 

That said, there will undoubtedly be a greater variety of IC subnet types in the future (such as the "badlands" proposal), which might even allow grandma (and her 5-10 year old cellphone) to get in on the action for those who love the primitive, 100% unstoppable concept of millions of permissionless nodes validating their transaction. As a bonus, you could probably cook your dinner and do your laundry while you wait for your one transaction to finalize during one of those cat videos.

-------------------------

esquivada | 2023-01-07 11:12:22 UTC | #48

exactly, that the NNS right now has the most centralized voting power does not mean that it is not a completely decentralized protocol since the protocol itself has the consensus mechanism through liquid democracy to distribute the voting power as the participants wish thus having a fully decentralized governance. It is true that Dfinity as the biggest contributor and founder of IC has the biggest voting power.  but as time goes by it will decrease

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-01-07 11:44:54 UTC | #49

Absolutely. It's also not just token holders but all stakeholders can have a say, to include users, investors, app developers, and infrastructure providers through the NNS.

passio | 2023-01-07 23:04:41 UTC | #50

-99% is really an excellent moment to sell all your bag. Amazing.

So, what other magic coin did you find to replace this ICP centralized coin ? 

You criticize, you criticize, you criticize... But, I'm still looking for when the topic bounces back to contribute something constructive?

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-01-08 05:03:22 UTC | #51

I did wonder about that. I would understand not wanting to put more money into a project one views as deeply flawed, but selling at this stage seems strange since OP begin his post by saying ICP could become a top 5 coin.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-08 06:12:30 UTC | #53

Sunk cost fallacy, if you invest for a particular reason, and that reason turns out to be unsound and you start losing money, you should just cut your loses IMO. Yes I think ICP can become a top 5 coin, BNB is a top 5 coin yet I consider it unsound..

Would you agree that democracy **is** decentralization compared to monarchy and aristocracy? Or tyranny and oligarchy?

-------------------------

mparikh | 2023-01-08 06:29:19 UTC | #55

So would you care to explain your rationale when you did start to invest? I presume you knew about the NNS and it's power at the time of investment.

Did something about the NNS change that you didn't like? Or it was just that you didn't think deeply enough about the NNS and it's implications.

I have read through the entire topic many times. I do find some well articulated reasoning...post-facto. But i am more interested in your rationale when you did invest.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-08 06:40:38 UTC | #56

I think the beauty of decentralized systems is they're designed such that they can function without any authoritative party involved other than the rules the participants accept to abide by, by using the system. I have deep scepticisms about democracy as a process in general, it's downsides aren't as obvious as tyrannies, monarchies etc but are nonetheless deadly.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-08 06:53:40 UTC | #57

I just liked the branding (Why did they change the dope internetcomputer.org homepage ?!?!) and the tech seemed more sophisticated than I realized, again probably because of the branding. Being financially exposed is what prompted me to think deeper about the actual systems involved in ICP.

-------------------------

Denis | 2023-01-08 07:58:13 UTC | #58

To each their own of course but how is sticking with it a sunk cost fallacy if you believe ICP might 100x from this point, which is the minimum it would take to be a top 5 coin because an upmove would definitely be part of a secular bull run in which most top coins would see major gains? Say I have 1000 ICP. Would it make sense to sell it for around 4000 USD, which is too trivial an amount to be much use to any investor, when there is some chance I could a couple of years down the line make 4,00,000 USD with it?
I've made some pretty bad investing decisions alongside some decent ones, but when I've sold at a huge loss it has always been because I felt a project had no future, that the max gain I could hope for from the ATL was 4x or 5x and more likely it would continue to trend downwards.

-------------------------

Kurtis0108 | 2023-01-08 08:34:02 UTC | #59

I said it has the potential to be, not that I believe it's a top 5 coin waiting for price discovery. The best meter I have for how something's going to perform is how much I like it, I don't think I can dislike something and consider it a worthy investment because ultimately my personal feelings are closer to other people's feelings than my logical reasoning about how other people may or may not act.

-------------------------

passio | 2023-01-08 11:09:50 UTC | #60

So, you didn’t give us names of better crypto than ICP ?

-------------------------

esquivada | 2023-01-08 13:02:53 UTC | #61

So Alin,I understand what you're saying is that it's technically possible to build it on the IC and that it will if the NNS decides to implement  it.

-------------------------

free | 2023-01-08 16:36:01 UTC | #62

I do. And it's really the only way to (practically) scale the network beyond 10x of what it is now.

Imagine still having humans (whether it's DFINITY; or someone else; or a bunch of named neurons each controlling some 10-20% of the voting power) having to put together and vote through proposals to replace every single broken replica on thousands of subnets consisting of tens of thousands of servers. Even if physically possible, it would be utter chaos.

So building in automation and a having the NNS manage the IC at a (much) higher level (as in e.g. "approve onboarding of 1K more nodes in Asia, 80% of them storage focused") is the only possible way that the IC could scale to anything like its imagined scale. So if DFINITY or whoever is still in direct control of assigning machines to subnets in a few years' time, I would be more concerned about why growth has stalled to that extent; than about lack of decentralization or scalability

I think the inflation/unlocking is causing mathematical quirks that is throwing off the market price, and the market price watchers. As an investor, I'm very neutral on the question of whether now is a good time to invest.

I would like to hope so, but my hope is not based on this forum, nor on the marketing, but merely in my faith of crypto enthusiasts recognizing the potential of this protocol.

-------------------------

Sormarler | 2023-01-10 07:23:04 UTC | #67

$ICP needs to move beyond crypto enthusiasts. These people function on narratives rather than the tech and its usefulness. Hopefully IC can be useful to people building real products that improves lives.

I would like to express my appreciation for the insightful and professional comments provided. As a non-technical user, I have observed similar issues with scalability, centralization, and top-down approach of . Your observations and analysis have effectively articulated my own observations and concerns.

I sincerely hope that the leadership of Dfinity takes these comments into serious consideration and takes action to address these issues. With a current market valuation of one billion dollars, it is imperative that these issues are addressed in a timely manner. Failure to do so may result in a significant decline in value and an erosion of the community, ultimately making a full recovery improbable. In addition, I believe that professional investors would likely reallocate their resources elsewhere.

maybe he bought at a -98% , and now sold at -99%, no big deal :slight_smile: .
regarding NNS, I'm not sure if even Bitcoin is more decentralized that NNS voting mechanism, because for example who are the ones controlling the BTC upgrade mechanism and protocol, isn't it just a repo on github, with a group of developers contributing to it?  And decisions of what will be deployed to the miners, is 100% miner decision, so nobody else controls the network, apart from all mining pools, who are like a group of corporations and they're the only ones who will tell all their miners in a pool which version to upgrade to, and which to ignore (remember the segwit debate and split of bitcoin to bitcoin-cash and few other forks? because miners are in control and anyone else who is not a '100% in miners interest' does not have a vote).  Maybe NNS is the best possible solution for now? at least it allows the stakers and the developers into the voting process....

-------------------------

Internationalwaters | 2023-01-12 17:28:02 UTC | #74

Sounds like a slimmed down internet computer. Diet ICP.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-17 03:28:32 UTC | #75

Mind elaborating on what happened?

-------------------------

free | 2023-01-17 10:51:32 UTC | #76

What happened was that at that time the ICP to XDR exchange rate (which determines the ICP to cycles conversion rate) was set by an oracle, by voting on NNS proposals. And there was one such proposal every N minutes.

Additionally, there was a single upper limit on the number of proposals of all types for which rewards had not yet been distributed. Rewards are distributed once a day.

The bug that triggered the issue (IIRC) had something to do with the rewards calculation (in the Governance Canister) failing, possibly because it required too many instructions to complete. More instructions than could be executed in a single round. As a result, rewards could no longer be distributed and the list of proposals whose rewards had not been distributed kept growing.

When the list size hit the limit after a day or so, no more proposals could be created. Including proposals to upgrade the Governance Canister to a newer version, that would have been able to compute voting rewards without trapping and consume the backlog.

So a disaster recovery was required to get the Governance Canister out of this deadlock. (Everything else still worked, except you couldn't make any new NNS proposals.) A disaster recovery on a subnet other than the NNS can be done via an NNS proposal, forcing the replicas to restart using a new replica binary. But a disaster recovery on the NNS requires node operators to manually deploy a new replica binary (or maybe, in this particular case, a new Governance Canister, I don't remember).

Once two thirds of the replicas had been manually upgraded, the Governance Canister was able to consume the backlog of proposal rewards and everything went back to normal. After that, measures were taken to prevent something like this reoccurring, including having a separate limit for some types of proposals (so e.g. the Governance Canister could be upgraded even if exchange rate proposals were backlogged).

but in all other blockchains there is no benefit from either expansion or contraction of the total pool of miners/nodes, they all just burn electricity and do no useful work except allowing the consensus and security. But total number doesn't even matter. So how can it be compared, if the reasons and benefits of scale out and scale in, are completely different?  that's simply a wrong way to think about it and compare to other blockchains imho.

In the current landscape, all(most) projects seem to be stuck in the loop of focusing on improving TPS and make transactions cheaper while having the same features as Ethereum, however only ICP is forging a new path. (beside Flux and Point.Network that try to do something similar )

If ICP begins to see more adoption, particularly from non-crypto projects that bear the brunt in crypto winters, it could be unstoppable. 

It's puzzling though why so many developers are rushing to Solana, despite its known instability and downtimes, instead of choosing building on ICP.

-------------------------

willguest | 2023-06-08 07:55:25 UTC | #86

I think one of the more uncommented features of the IC is that it puts the reponsibility for demand-led factors  in the hands of the developers, much like it does with the reverse gas model.

In my opinion, this is the right way to do it. Demand should not (overly) driven by speculation, but grounded in functionality. When the IC gets better (I'm workin' on a piece of it), there will naturally be increasing demand, driven by the utility of the network.

Let me ask you this. Does 'using the internet to do stuff' follow a boom and bust cycle? I mean, there might be correlates, but it's just not the right question to ask. If it must be put in terms of economics, a better question might be "does the benefit of buying ICP outweigh the opportunity cost?" which requires an answer that is really up to the individual, driven by their actual usage of the token, but again this comes back to the utility, which will inevitably grow.

For me, there is a big enough first mover advantage here that it guarantees at least a decade of market dominance while others figure it out and replicate the concept.

-------------------------

CryptoCat | 2023-06-08 13:56:14 UTC | #87

Democracy vs. decentralization is not the correct way to frame this issue.

ICP is the only option if you want a dapp that is democratically controlled. The alternative is, the developer controls everything (in addition to the cloud provider). Not only is that not decentralized, it's totalitarian.

I understand that you are concerned about immutability. However, the solution is not to scrap the NNS. If you want immutability, simply require a consensus vote to remove anything. At that point, the system would have the same immutability as Ethereum - except without a centralized front-end.
