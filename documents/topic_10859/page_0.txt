Hello,

When using React Router child routes, a child route/URL can not be rendered when the browser is refreshed, or the link is opened directly. This can be fixed if the web server rewrites the URL to index.html: https://ui.dev/react-router-cannot-get-url-refresh#nginx-conf.

I understand that asset canisters only serve static content, but is possible for the IC to provide configuration for URL rewrites?

Thanks.

Hello :slight_smile: 
I did not have such a problem and routing works both locally and in production.
I am using `react-router-dom@5.3.0` and `Router` with passed history object.
Can you provide more details?

Thank you @3cL1p5e7. I discovered that the URLs were incorrect due to an environment setting during build.

I am now able to refresh child routes and open them directly in the browser. So, it appears that the IC is actually handling the URL rewrite for us, which is great!
