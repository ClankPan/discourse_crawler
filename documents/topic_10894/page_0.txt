If it’s a Motoko canister you can search by canister id here to get the interface: [https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app](https://k7gat-daaaa-aaaae-qaahq-cai.ic0.app/)

If it’s not available there you check the project GitHub repo or contact the developer (maybe also ask them to [serve the candid from their canister](https://github.com/dfinity/ic/blob/c48280bbeec347a6b73160199566c612bd8ccbf7/rs/nns/governance/canister/canister.rs#L944) or create a listing above).
