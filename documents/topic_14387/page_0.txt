Hi all,

I would like to give an implementation update on the motion proposal [compounding maturity](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) which was approved in March’22.

Following an interactive implementation approach, the NNS team will be able to release the first part of this motion proposal covering maturity modulation this week. This means that whenever a new neuron is spawned, the ICP amount minted is modulated taking recent ICP price movements into account.

For further details on the modulation function please refer to this [wiki article](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Maturity_modulation).

The remaining features of this motion proposal are being worked on.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-18 18:09:48 UTC | #2

Please don't release this update without providing a way to move maturity between neurons. Some of us have many neurons with different lockups and merge all the maturity in a 8 year neuron. With this change it won't be possible to do this without incurring in the modulation.

-------------------------

Hi @bjoernek,

Thank you for this !

Have you thought about the addition of the possibility to convert maturity into staked ICP within the neuron whose it is the maturity ?

Currently, the proposal only plans to allow : 
– the conversion of the LIQUID maturity into STAKED maturity 
– the conversion of the LIQUID maturity into LIQUID ICP

But not the the conversion of the LIQUID maturity into *staked* ICP

@Manu ([here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/207?u=roman)) and I ([here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/2?u=roman) and [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/219?u=roman)) talked about the importance of this feature (which is the current feature), because a lot of people will prefer staked ICP to staked maturity. Both stakers have the same purpose : stake, but we force people wanting to accumulate staked ICP rather than staked maturity to spawn ICP before restaking it within their neurons. 

I know @jwiegley added this point in the system and gave us the possibility to discuss it further. How is your thinking about this ?

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-18 21:13:03 UTC | #4

+1 to what @Roman wrote.

For neuron holders who take the conservative approach of treating daily maturity as a taxable event, it wouldn't make much sense to convert LIQUID maturity into STAKED maturity. What would make sense is the current Merge Maturity functionality, the conversion of LIQUID maturity into *staked* ICP. It would be unfortunate if neuron holders who want to continue to Merge Maturity in this way have to jump through hoops and spawn/restake every time they want to Merge Maturity, and be subject to maturity modulation. 

Put another way, it doesn't make sense to penalize neuron holders (poor UX and possibly decreased rewards) who are just trying to follow the tax laws and guidance in their jurisdiction and aren't even selling any ICP.

If neuron holders were able to opt in or out of this new system, I'd think that would also address this.

[/quote]

Pleased consider making this an opt-in feature. For me personally, I have been against the whole proposal and don't feel it fits into the way I want to have my accounting set up. Others feel differently. This change is complicated in various ways and its effects on taxes will be different depending on jurisdiction.

To help each individual cope with their own situation, why not make this an opt-in feature? This allows both points of view to exist in parallel. It could be nice to test the system in this way as well, instead of going all-in and forcing the change across all users. If things go as planned and perhaps more legal clarity comes, maybe in the future the change can be completed whether or not people opted-in.

Hi all, 
many thanks for your inputs! I am conscious of the fact that this motion proposal was subject to a long and intense discussion, shortly before I joined the Internet computer ship. So please bear with me in case that I do not capture all nuances of prior discussions in my answers, but I will try my best ;-)

Quoting from the initiating [medium article](https://medium.com/dfinity/proposal-to-improve-icp-governance-staking-re-tax-and-tokenomics-df09903a2e0b) 
"There is a danger that a lack of understanding leads authorities to draw false links between the maturity of a neuron, ICP tokens, and realized income. Therefore, we must further harden the design of the framework to reduce this risk, by having maturity produce an indeterminate number of ICP (that is, so that given some amount of maturity, it cannot be predicted how much ICP it might eventually produce)."
it is my understanding that the proposal did not contain on purpose a way to convert liquid maturity to staked ICP (although I understand from where you are coming from).

In my personal opinion, I am less worried about the +/- 5% modulation factor (given the overall volatility in the crypto market) but rather increasing the system complexity by introducing a further term "staked maturity". When this is implemented in the next step (as per the agreed motion proposal) we have to make sure that the NNS interface makes it as easy as possible to follow this process for normal users.

Again quoting from the [medium article](https://medium.com/dfinity/proposal-to-improve-icp-governance-staking-re-tax-and-tokenomics-df09903a2e0b) 
"Neuron maturity is an attribute of neurons, which cannot exist independently, and cannot be separated from the neuron to which it belongs. This makes it impossible to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of neuron maturity."
moving around maturity from neuron to neuron does not seem to be aligned with intent of the motion proposal (although I understand why you are asking for that given the way you manage your neuron portfolio.)

If this feature is marked as opt-in, then to my understanding we would defeat the purpose of the motion proposal which has the very aim to ensure that it cannot be predicted how much ICP is produced from maturity.

I was only using the terms of the proposal itself as show the photo and overall the [introduction](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011?u=roman) of the proposal to the forum when we have been asked to give a feedback to Dfinity : 

[quote="jwiegley, post:1, topic:11011"]
## Change 1: Staked maturity

Each neuron presently has an amount of ICP staked and an amount of maturity earned. In order to introduce the idea of “staked maturity” as separate from “maturity”, the two amounts will be tracked separately.

I disagree about such a description of the purpose of the motion proposal : it has the very aim to ensure that it cannot be predicted how much ICP is produced from maturity, yes, BUT ONLY TO avoid the tax burden for PRECISE people suffering of THEIR tax jurisdiction. I am in favor of relieving them of course, but we are not all in this case, and the disappearing of the tax suffering for this people is about to become an appearing of suffering for other ones. It is perfectly consistent to let predictability for those not suffering from it. We don't need to go from an extremum to another one : by going to predictability for everyone TO unpredictability to everyone.

By setting this features an opt-in feature : the ones that this proposal was aiming to relieve are relieved, and the ones that have never been concerned by tax problematics keep going on without having to suffer anything.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-19 09:44:36 UTC | #11

I already raised the issue when the proposal was being discussed and this is what @jwiegley said:

-------------------------

Agreed I don't see how being opt in makes this proposal left effective other than showing those who opt in do it for tax evasion purpose only.

It will not relief anyone from their tax obligation.  This is the problem.  For some reason, Dfinity did not wanted to seek a professional tax firm advice and it looks like their blockchain scientist became a tax expert on the fly.  I think they will put many investors with serious tax problem, as I mentionned many time in the main thread.
If they leave the option for accurate calculation as of now, at least it would be optional for people who want take the chance thinking IRS will not tax them because the rewards are modulated.  If they don't, all investors where tax apply, will be forced to move in the grey zone (black TMO) of taxes.
The irony is that Dfinity acknoledge that the California tax accountant said thoses rewards were taxable.
Just cannot understand the whole situation why they do this.
Some people are critisizing Dfinity should focus on the layer 1 only of the blockchain.  Programming for tax purposes, for some countries only, is mindblowing.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-19 12:22:00 UTC | #14

Why has Dfinity decided to prioritize this proposal over others much more important for the NNS to work properly such as [55651](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/55651) and [38985](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/38985)? 

In my opinion it shouldn't have been a priority as it doesn't provide significant benefits to the average stakers, if anything it makes the already complex system harder to understand and use. 


https://forum.dfinity.org/t/way-forward-on-spam-proposal-for-tactical-fix/14275?u=zane

>We consider other features that are planned to have a lower priority and hence suggest tackling them after the SNS rollout. This includes for example the work on compounding maturity, the community fund and spam prevention.

It also seems to contradict what was previously stated, Dfinity didn't have time to work on a true spam fix due to the SNS taking up all the resources, but somehow the least useful feature got prioritized and is about to be shipped. Do internal plans change that often in a matter of weeks? If so Dfinity should do a better job at communicating them.

-------------------------

lastmjs | 2022-07-19 12:56:04 UTC | #15

If it's opt-in and you can't opt-out, then for those who opted-in they wouldn't be able to predict the ICP from the maturity, correct?

-------------------------

Avocado | 2022-07-19 13:50:40 UTC | #16

It is not entirely clear why the developers should waste precious time on such an update. How does it improve the IC network? This will only complicate the understanding of staking for beginners, for whom these neurons with dissolve delay and maturity were already difficult to understand.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-19 17:27:02 UTC | #17

[quote="bjoernek, post:7, topic:14387"]

[/quote]

It sounds like the new system is not going to be opt-in and the +/- 5% modulation will be enforced for all minting of ICP rewards. It that's the case, I would suggest that for the sake of the UX, Merge Maturity should still be supported. That is, there should be a Merge Maturity button (i.e., convert liquid maturity to staked ICP) that does something like this:

*The merge maturity operation begins a 7-day clock that completes with a modulation of the amount to be merged. At the end of the 7 days, this final amount of newly minted ICP will be automatically added to the staked ICP of the neuron.*

This would be a better UX than having to go through multiple steps to merge maturity (disburse maturity, then remember to increase stake 7 days later).

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-07-19 17:59:35 UTC | #18

Afaik there is a new type of maturity introduced with this proposal, called *staked maturity*, which will be used when merging maturity in a neuron.

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-19 18:14:50 UTC | #19

Yes, I understand the new `stake_maturity` functionality described in the proposal. I'm suggesting that the existing `merge_maturity` functionality could also be included, but in a modified form to fit in with the rules of the new system. This would be useful for neuron holders who stake their voting rewards and want to pay taxes for those rewards in the year the rewards are received, rather than waiting to pay taxes on those staked rewards until the neuron is dissolved.

Measures originating from the community are not treated the same as those originating from within Dfinity. Since governance proposals are not self-executing, we still depend on Dfinity, and it is no surprise that they prioritise their own priorities. In this case, the instructions came from the very top, too.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-20 17:27:07 UTC | #22

This is great, ideally we don't need to wait for 7 days but immediately convert the maturity into staked ICP with the modulation applying of course.

Could you also speak with the team of the possibility to convert the STAKED maturity directly into STAKED ICP eventually ? Currently, the staked maturity is sentenced to keep being staked maturity until the neuron dissolution without any possibility of conversion of this kind of maturity.

By offering the possibility to convert STAKED maturity into STAKED ICP, of course applying again the price modulation, people can come back from STAKED maturity to ICP without having to dissolve their neuron : by doing this we offer the possibility to those wanting to EVENTUALLY get ICP only to benefit of the auto compounding feature (because, yes, some people don't want to get STAKED maturity).

In summary, we need more conversions to staked ICP, even applying the price modulation because some people want to keep staked ICP ONLY and then don't want to use the staked maturity, but maybe they could find benefit in using it if they could use it to auto compound before converting the stake maturity into staked ICP.  

I think that, as long as you keep your price modulation feature, and then the unpredictability of conversion, these other possibilities are legit.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-20 09:16:22 UTC | #23

I will also include this suggestion as input for the discussion on the next round. 
As mentioned above, personally I am a bit sceptical because this seems to go against the spirt of the motion proposal, but I am happy to collect further opinions on it.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-20 09:23:29 UTC | #24

Thanks for the input and yes I will include the ideas on conversion to staked ICP in the discussion with the team. 

As a side comment: The purpose of the 7 day period is to have the uncertainty thus immediate conversion would probably not work.

Will we have to possibility to mint a portion or 100% from a 8 years staked maturity to a 8 years ICP neurons? 
Or if a staked maturity account is completely frozen for the choosen time just the same as an actual neurons?
Will we have to possibilty to manage both an ICP staked neurons and staked maturity neurons?

There is no such things as staked neurons. Neurons are currently constituted by : 
– staked ICP (it is not the neuron which is staked, but ICP : you stake ICP to create a neuron)
– maturity (so said « liquid »)

Once the proposal implemented, a neuron will be constituted by : 
– staked ICP
– liquid maturity
– staked maturity (if you previously staked liquid maturity)
You will be able to disburse your liquid maturity as ICP or stake it as maturity, in the second case, it will become a staked maturity that you won’t be able to manage anymore once staked until your neuron’s dissolve delay reach zero, just as you can’t do anything with your staked ICP before the dissolution of your neuron. 

So see the staked maturity as staked ICP without having totally the same nature (you will even be able to have a neuron with 0 staked ICP and 100% of staked maturity). 

So, one neuron : staked ICP + maturity (to disburse or to stake). If you stake the liquid maturity totally, your neuron become : staked ICP + staked maturity. And you won’t be able to get back your staked maturity before your staked ICP (or the contrary) : they are staked in the same boat, called « neuron » !

Only one difference : you can "exchange" your liquid maturity for staked ICP (it is explained in the proposal), by doing this, you kind of withdraw your staked ICP and replace them with staked maturity ; to say it differently, it is like indirectly convert staked ICP into staked maturity, BUT you can't indirectly convert staked maturity into staked ICP : here is the difference between staked ICP and staked maturity : one can become the other, but the other can't become the first one (this is how you can eventually have neurons constituted only by staked maturity without implying any staked ICP anymore).

**This is why I was asking to @bjoernek the possibility to exchange the staked maturity for staked ICP, rather than only allow exchange the staked ICP for staked maturity** : some of us prefer having neurons without any staked ICP, for countability and tax reasons, but not only this.

I hope it will help you.

Wow, million thanks for your generous explanation.  

Mays I ask you quickly the process for someone who will want to use a portion of his rewards every month?  Example a person receive approximately 100 ICP equivalent in maturity and want to keep approx 20 icp for living and reinvest the rest in the 8 years lock up maturity?  Will there be a way to cash only a portion on regular interval?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-20 15:17:33 UTC | #29

Of course, in the current state of the implementation to come, you will have the choice between 3 ways of doing things : 

**First possibility :** 
1 – Click on "Disburse Maturity", choose the percentage of maturity you will have accumulated (in your case, 20%). Once it is done, you will have to wait for 7 days before getting your 20ICP DIRECTLY transferred into your ACCOUNT (there will not be neuron created anymore like there is right now when you spawn your maturity)
2 – Click on "Stake Maturity" for the 80% of your remaining maturity.

**Second possibility :** 
1 – Click on "Disburse Maturity" and choose to disburse 100% of maturity you will have accumulated. Again, once it is done, you will have to wait for 7 days before getting your 100 ICP DIRECTLY transferred into your ACCOUNT
2 – Click on "Stake ICP" and select 80% of your received 100 ICP in your account, to stake 80 ICP into your neuron.

The difference is : in the first case, you stake maturity, whereas in the second one, you stake ICP

**Third possibility :** 
1 – Exchange 20% of your maturity for STAKED 20 ICP : it will withdraw 20 staked ICP of your neuron and will "replace" it with 20% of staked maturity. The 20 ICP will be unstaked and will be transferred into your account.
2 – Stake the 80% of your not yet staked maturity (or liquid maturity) remaining in the neuron

jwiegley | 2022-07-20 19:16:31 UTC | #30

Although I started the original discussion on this feature, I want to go on record that I think it is a very bad idea. I predict it will not benefit price, not help anyone with their taxes, and it will further complicate an already very complicated system -- in ways that may introduce unknown complications that will themselves have to be mitigated later, as happened with changing voting weights. Clever ideas on top of complex systems often seem like a good idea before they are put into practice.

Instead, I think the IC should double down on stability and correctness, and give the market a few years to show us, by real data, where the NNS needs to change with respect to maturity.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-07-20 20:43:33 UTC | #31

Hi all, FYI the change on maturity modulation is now live.

-------------------------

coteclaude | 2022-07-21 00:27:13 UTC | #32

John, doing this disclosure is all to you honor.  Not because you say and think exactly what I am saying from the beginning, but because you are telling us that, although you were opposed in this change, you were doing what you were told to do and had no other option as a Dfinity employee.  Many times you wrote us that you were going to ask to the team, tell to the team, etc.
With all the respect, I also see @bjoernek doing the same thing now.  He also tell us he will ask to the team, talk to the team.  Lately, it was obvious to me, that the relyed a pre-formated answer explaining why Dfinity was reverting their own vote and take back the governance weight to 1.  He said it was because the spams were confusing the newbies and kind of preventing the growth of the ecosystem. The problem with this excuse is that some people said they were trusting him for the given reason.
Following this logic, how can we convince a new investor to lock his ICP in the NNS and explain him how the rewards works from now.  Total, total, total non sense.
With your disclosure, you confirm what many of us already suspected, meaning what Dfinity employees post here on the forum does not mean they believe in it, neither agree with it but need a paycheck for their family, wich I truly understand.  
This is a lot of courage on your part and I truly appreciate the person that you are.

Tip for running an organization efficiently:
Everyone should stay in their field of expertise
Marketing expert do the marketing
Communication expert take care of communication
Human ressource management expert manage human ressources
Tax firm expert manage and advice on tax management
Chief scientist blockchain stay in the blockchain development and programming.
And chief scientist blockchain stay away from Twitter.

Simple, right?

EDIT:  For people who may be tempted to answer me that this post is not relevant to this forum, I want tell them that it does a lot.  Now people will think twice before voting.
If @jwiegley would have made this disclosure (like I do it but think it is bad) before the vote, the result may (would) have been much different.

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-07-23 17:09:59 UTC | #33

Thank you, cote. Your response prompts me to clarify one more thing: Although I have had disagreements with some of DFINITY's ideas, I've been proven wrong enough times that I'm willing to wait a moment before publicly voicing an objection. I had my reservations about compounding maturity from the beginning -- and said so many times internally -- but I always knew that I could be wrong, and that I wanted to know the opinion of the majority without swaying the vote due to my position at DFINITY. Therefore, like the idea or not, it was important for me to stay neutral and simply facilitate the discussion rather than direct it.

I'm speaking up now because much time has passed, I've had opportunity to consider the idea further along with its implications, and now as an outsider my neutrality is not so much an issue. I speak as a long-term stakeholder in the network, and a private individual who is committed to its enduring success.

So, if Björn is not voicing objections, please don't think it's because he bottles them up in fear of endangering his livelihood. This is not the case. As builders of the IC we were/are servants of the community, and it's important for us to hear from you what you want that network to be. In order to do so, our own voice must sometimes take a back seat.

-------------------------

mparikh | 2022-07-21 05:24:37 UTC | #34

Thanks John, for this clarification. A few questions:

At the time of running the proposal (48623) through NNS & all it's debate on this forum,  you had doubts about the proposal that you articulated internally (to dfinity) but didn't do so externally.

If so, why didnt you simply abstain for running the proposal? Why did someone who was completely convinced that this was the right proposal head running this proposal? 

Since you wanted to know the opinion of the majority and facilitate the discussion, what opinion did you form from the discussion on the forum?

Were you authorized to pull the proposal out of consideration (or felt that you could pull this proposal out of consideration) prior to it reaching the NNS for voting?

-------------------------

jwiegley | 2022-07-21 19:52:11 UTC | #35

Some quick answers:

1. Since my disagreement was not moral, but merely technical, I had no issue with implementing it against my objections. As a principal engineer working in that area of the product, it was my responsibility to execute the designs of my CTO and CEO.

2. The opinion I formed is that the community is very divided on this matter, and so DFINITY should proceed with caution.

3. No, I did not have that authority. I was able to give feedback on the design at all levels, but the executive decision was not in my hands.

Roman, just want confirm if the amount of ICp for the 7 days Disburse Maturity will be subject to the modulation?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-23 09:47:42 UTC | #37

Totally ! 

Disburse maturity and Exchange maturity will be subject to modulation. To say it in a simpler way : every move from maturity (liquid one or staked one) to ICP will be modulated. 

So, just think : « if my operation implies ICP, it is modulated »

-------------------------

Dylan | 2022-07-23 17:28:23 UTC | #38

[quote="Roman, post:37, topic:14387"]

[/quote]

My understanding of [proposal 48623](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623) is that exchanging maturity does not mint ICP and is therefore not subject to maturity modulation.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-23 18:34:36 UTC | #39

It does not mint ICP, but your maturity has nevertheless an equivalence to a determined amount of ICP and this amount is the same in both cases : either minted ICP, or exchanged ICP. It is the market conditions which say how much ICP your maturity worth, and up to you to get this equal amount by using "disburse" or "exchange", but the amount stays the same.

So let us say that you have 10 staked ICP within a neuron, you have 10% of maturity and the market conditions are terrible : 
– either you ***disburse*** your maturity and will receive : 1ICP minus the 5% of modulation = 0,95ICP
– or you ***exchange*** your maturity for staked ICP in the neuron, while converting that maturity (10%) into staked maturity (10%) : but by doing this, you withdraw 10% of your staked ICP minus the 5% of modulation = 0,95ICP, given the fact that it is what worths your maturity due to the market condition of my example.

Again, the ICP worth of maturity is the same, the only difference is between letting staked ICP in your neuron and "empty" your neuron by replacing its ICP with staked ICP, to eventually get only staked ICP within your neuron, if you want. But as long as you trade your maturity for ICP or staked ICP, the amount of ICP is modulated : the only way to not suffer or benefit the modulation is by converting your maturity into staked maturity and letting your staked ICP as they are (it means, by not using "exchange" feature).

In one word "move anyone of your ICP, in a way or another, and the modulation applies, just stake your maturity without doing any exchange, and you are invisible for the modulation" : 
– disburse maturity make ICP move, then the modulation applies
– exchange maturity make ICP move, then the modulation applies
– simply stake maturity does not, then the modulation does not apply

Where in the proposal does it say this? If it worked in this way, the maturity modulation would be applied twice to the same maturity, first when you exchanged maturity and second when you dissolved the neuron.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-24 06:48:11 UTC | #41

Yes you are right, this is true. I may be wrong about exchange, then. But I am not sure at all, because in that case that I believe in, it would not matter to have a double application of the modulation on the maturity, as none ICP would be lost in the first application (let us take again my example) :  

0,95 ICP would be withdrawn from your 10 staked ICP, so you would have 9,05 staked ICP in your neuron. I would be ok with your point if a double loss (malus) resulted from the double application of the modulation, but it is not the case. Then, eventually there would be only one true application of the modulation in this case too. 



@bjoernek ? Could you tell us if exchange maturity implies the modulation too ?

[/quote]

Hi @Roman, quoting from the motion proposal 

[quote]
## `exchange_maturity`

If there is sufficient staked ICP in the neuron, this operation exchanges maturity for staked ICP in the neuron, while converting that maturity into staked maturity.

### Example

* Before `exchange_maturity`: Neuron has 100 ICP stake, 0 staked maturity and 10 maturity.
* After `exchange_maturity`: Neuron has 90 ICP stake 10 staked maturity and 0 maturity. 10 ICP is immediately transferred to the user account.
[/quote]

Thus exchange_maturity is not subject to modulation (but has the pre-condition to have sufficient staked ICP in the neuron in the first place). 

Once the neuron with staked maturity dissolves and staked maturity is disbursed, then the modulation applies. 

Does this answer your question?

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-07-26 18:45:36 UTC | #43

Of course ! Thank you very much @bjoernek ! I was reading, in the text you quoted, « 10 maturity » as « maturity worthing 10 ICP once the modulation applied ». 

Thanks a lot 🙏 (my mistake @Dylan ! 😉)

Ciaran | 2022-07-28 09:32:02 UTC | #44

Amen. The most successful L1s will be the most simple and most stable.

justmythoughts | 2022-07-31 18:20:02 UTC | #45

@bjoernek one question regarding the timeline of implementation for this proposal.

What does the timeline around the different rollouts of the compounding maturity feature look like?

Specifically, as one of the main functions of this proposal is to be able to convert maturity from to `staked_maturity` (instead of the current `merged_maturity`), when can NNS voters expect this to happen? The reason why I say this, is that if this feature is coming out soon, it may make sense for certain voters who were originally concerned about taxes and wanted this proposal to hold off on spawning neurons or merging maturity until the feature is released.

Since one of the primary reasons this proposal was brought forth was to decrease ICP selling pressure for tax reasons, having a more concrete timeline around this feature's delivery should give these early/seed investors more clarity and therefore a reason to hold off on spawning neurons and selling their ICP if the `staked_maturity` conversion feature is close enough to completion.

-------------------------

Denis | 2022-08-12 03:19:01 UTC | #46

Cross-posting from the Community fund thread:
Maybe I am misreading here, but it seems that through this method, maturity is calculated as equivalent to a certain amount of ICP at a given time.
Does this not go against the grain of the tax-related proposal which aims to obscure how much exactly maturity is worth by adding a modulating mechanism at dissolution? In other words, if we can calculate exactly how much the maturity in a neuron contributing to the community fund is worth, would that not also apply to the maturity of all other neurons, which can then be used by tax authorities to determine taxable income?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-08-12 06:43:31 UTC | #47

Hi @justmythoughts, apologies for the late reply (I was on PTO). 

In the moment the engineering team focuses on the big SNS release targeting September. 

Subsequently further governance items will be tackled (periodic confirmation, manual voting, staked maturity, etc). The precise order is not yet defined. 

So I cannot give you a good estimate for the timeline of staked maturity yet.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-10-12 01:13:21 UTC | #48

Hi all, 

here is an update on the work of the motion proposal on Compounding maturity. 

1. The work on staking maturity (which replaces merge maturity) progressed well and I expect that this will be released for for the NNS II UX towards end of this week or next week. 
2. In a subsequent step, this will be also introduced for the NNS hardware wallet UX and for NNS quill. 
3. I have written a short wiki page giving an overview on neuron operations related to maturity which is [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/NNS_neuron_operations_related_to_maturity). Feedback is very welcome. 
4. Following up on the suggestions in this thread to support automatic re-staking of the newly minted ICP, this could be done by enhancing the future disburse maturity functionality. This would provide a similar functionality to the previous merge function, but with the 7 day delay & modulation applied. DFINITY is looking into how best to support this.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-10-13 13:43:20 UTC | #49

Hi all, the release proposal for introducing staking maturity in the NNS II UX (step 1 mentioned above) is planned to be submitted today.

-------------------------

Zane | 2022-10-14 10:38:26 UTC | #50

Would point 4 be used to move maturity between neurons? Cause if the only way to do it implies being subject to modulation then I doubt it will be done that often and surely not automatically.

Moving maturity between neurons is usually done to optimize long term yield, APY for an 8 year lockup is already low considering the timeframe and the uncertainty, so if it's 19%, I want 19%, but if modulation is applied in a downturn the APY won't actually be 19% due to having lost a % of tokens due to modulation, so instead of auto compound disbursed maturity it's better to wait for timeframes with positive modulation, so one can get the full APY + modulation bonus.

To my understanding, point 4 was mainly requested as a way to automate the workflow "spawn maturity to ICP" and "stake this ICP". This was raised by several people in this thread and also in other forum entries.

John, I can not even express how much I agree with you! I have been 100% opposing this proposal from the very beginning and still think it is a very, very bad idea! See my original post for the reasons opposing here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/request-for-feedback-compounding-maturity-proposal/11011/131?u=khm  I think those reasons still hold very true! Thank you for honestly expressing your view on this topic!

-------------------------

smaug | 2022-10-18 21:05:10 UTC | #54

The staked maturity is basically added to the neuron like before, right? And it will increase the voting power of that neuron and therefore rewards, correct?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-10-19 10:00:15 UTC | #55

This is correct. Staked maturity adds to your voting power (and hence voting rewards) in the same way as staked ICP does.

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-20 15:07:28 UTC | #56

Hi all,

Here is a further implementation update on the work of the [motion proposal ](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/48623)for maturity enhancements.

### Background

As previously communicated, staking maturity was rolled out for NNS Internet Identity. As a next step, this is planned to be released also for NNS hardware wallet controlled neurons and NNS Quill. A wiki page giving an overview on neuron operations related to maturity which is [here](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/NNS_neuron_operations_related_to_maturity).

In order to reflect changes in functionality for NNS hardware wallet controlled neurons Zondax needs to update the Ledger app. Hence, we aligned a roll-out plan with Zondax as the provider of the app.

### Planned next steps

Tuesday 20 Dec

* Release update of the NNS Front-end app. This disables the “Merge maturity” button for the current Ledger app 2.0.6. It enables the button “Stake maturity” for the future version of the Ledger app 2.0.7.
* Release update of the NNS back-end. This redirects calls from “Merge maturity to staking maturity.
* Release an update of NNS Quill, replacing “Merge maturity” by “Stake maturity”. One can already now download the [source code](https://github.com/dfinity/quill), compile it and stake maturity.

Wednesday 21 Dec:

* [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) releases Ledger app 2.0.7. Calls to the merge maturity (being now routed to stake maturity in the NNS back-end) will be displayed as stake maturity on the display of the Ledger device.

In a second phase, once a more comprehensive update of the Ledger app is available (which will also include auto-stake maturity), merge maturity will be disabled in the NNS back-end.

### What do you need to know as a user of a Ledger device?

After Tuesday 20 Dec, users of Ledger app version 2.0.6 will be able to continue to the Ledger device, but will not be able to stake maturity (nor the former merge maturity). Users who update to the Ledger app version 2.0.7 on Wednesday 21 Dec, will be able to stake maturity.

### What do you need to know as a user of NNS Quill?

Users are encouraged to update to the latest version of NNS Quill, which replaces the neuron manage command “--merge-maturity” by “--stake-maturity”. Users who continue to use prior versions of NNS Quill should be conscious of the fact that calling merge-maturity will result in staking maturity.

-------------------------

borovan | 2022-12-20 14:28:42 UTC | #57

Hi, does this include the ability to auto-stake maturity, or is that in a future release?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-20 15:06:28 UTC | #58

Good question! Auto-stake maturity will be part of the more comprehensive update. I will mention this explicitly in the above post.

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-12-21 19:42:38 UTC | #59

Dear @bjoernek,

Thank you for letting us know ! Do you still plan to perfect later the auto-staking feature by adding this following complexification :

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-22 08:23:20 UTC | #60

Yes @Roman, this is still the plan! 
We have to build anyway build a disbursal operation for the NNS, and as per community input this should include the ability to automatically re-stake (e.g. via a flag).

-------------------------

Roman | 2022-12-22 09:16:15 UTC | #61

This is wonderful ! Thanks a lot for your dedication @bjoernek ! 🙏

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-23 04:55:22 UTC | #62

Thanks ! Do we have a sense of when auto stake will be enabled for ledger devices ?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-23 06:26:09 UTC | #63

Hi @dfisher, given that auto-stake for Ledger devices mainly requires updates in the Ledger app, we are in touch with with Zondax to define the plan (the timing is tbc in the moment). I will provide an update to this thread once I know more.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-23 06:50:38 UTC | #64

Great thank you. The auto-stake feature is a game changer for peace of mind. Although I will miss my weekly ritual :)

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-23 13:08:36 UTC | #65

And will the next update also include SNS support for hardware wallets ?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2022-12-23 14:49:37 UTC | #66

That would be definitely on my wish list as well ! As this requires further discussions with Zondax, I do not know yet the timing.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2022-12-23 21:21:48 UTC | #67

I can see why automatic staking would definitely be better than staking. However, what's the difference between staked maturity vs. merged maturity for you, @dfisher? It must be significant if you are willing to incur the weekly effort of restaking maturity manually each week rather than using the automation of merged maturity. Is it because merged maturity can't ever be reversed without dissolving a neuron, whereas staking allows you to move new maturity to a new neuron with a different dissolve delay? Or is it for tax reasons (or both)? Finally, doesn't restaking cause spawning, which currently has a maturity modulation penalty of 4-5%? I'm still doing my due diligence, so sorry if these sound like basic questions.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2022-12-24 17:13:34 UTC | #68

Historically I merged maturity once a week. Now I will stake maturity once a week. I would prefer to auto compound staked maturity because it won't require any effort on my part and I can just let it run. But I need to wait until that feature is made available on the Ledger HW.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-16 03:21:36 UTC | #69

Looks like auto staking feature has been enabled for Ledger devices.

@bjoernek do you have a sense for when it will be updated for HSM devices?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-01-16 14:27:46 UTC | #70

Yes good news, auto-staking for Ledger devices is now enabled since Friday (for further reference see this [post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/new-release-nns-dapp-plenty-of-updates/17956) from @lmuntaner) 

Regarding HSM devices
* Do you refer to a Nitrokey HSM? 
* If you use it via a command line interface, then auto-staking is already enabled, as you have full access to all neuron operations.

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-17 03:18:04 UTC | #71

Yes exactly NitroKey HSM devices. A few questions. 

1. Why is the flag for staked maturity not visible in the UI in the NNS dApp where I have a neuron controlled by a NitroKey HSM (using a hot key)? 

2. What is the command using quill in the command line for windows to enable auto staked maturity? 

3. Do I need to download a newer version of quill? 

Thanks for all your help

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-01-17 15:31:27 UTC | #72

Hi @dfisher 
1. Hot key controls focus on performing actions with limited privileges, in particular voting & setting of following. Spawning maturity or staking maturity is not in scope of hotkey controls.  
2. The command for enabling auto-staking via NNS quill is 
`quill neuron-manage neuron_id --auto-stake-maturity enabled --pem-file identity.pem`
3. Yes. Please download the latest version here https://github.com/dfinity/quill.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-01-17 22:56:40 UTC | #73

Can we expect merging Neurons from the front end dapp to our ledger neuron to be an upcoming feature? Personally, I would prefer to merge and have my neuron be under that the extra layer of security. 

Admittedly, I thought this would imply neuron ownership and now I see a simple merge would suffice. 
Thanks,

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-01-18 10:52:24 UTC | #74

Hi @jsull9, neurons need to have the same controller to be  mergeable. I believe the reason for this constraint is that otherwise neurons would become transferable, opening up a neuron market.

-------------------------

jsull9 | 2023-01-18 13:51:10 UTC | #75

Oh gotcha so really we would need a “neuron market” of sorts to even merge the two? Or it would open up that flood gate of possibilities just off a merge?

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-01-18 15:40:26 UTC | #76

It is the latter. Allowing to merge neurons of two different principals could be used to sell neurons.

-------------------------

Sabr | 2023-01-18 16:31:34 UTC | #77

As a related question, is it possible to manage multiple principal IDs under the same hardware (Ledger) wallet, e.g., in order to manage a few small neurons of multiple family members under one wallet to avoid managing the off-site and fire-proof storage of multiple 24-word seed phrases?

-------------------------

dfisher | 2023-01-20 02:42:50 UTC | #78

Hi Team,

@bjoern kindly sent over the code. If you use a NitroKey HSM stick to manage your neurons, download the latest quill, and run the following code in the command line: 

"c:/Program Files/quill-windows-x86_64” neuron-manage --hsm --hsm-libpath "c:/Program Files/OpenSC Project/OpenSC/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.dll" [NEURONID] --auto-stake-maturity enabled > out.json

"c:/Program Files/quill-windows-x86_64" send out.json

@bjoernek / @bjoernek do you mind letting the NNS dApp team know that for neurons controlled by NitroKey HSM sticks that are hotkey'd to the NNS dApp, there is no flag (even if it is greyed out) to show whether the maturity is auto-staked or not. I understand that this is not something that can be controlled in the NNS dApp itself but it would be helpful to know if it is on auto-stake or not from the NNS dApp. 

Thanks!
David

lmuntaner | 2023-01-24 14:47:47 UTC | #79

Hi @dfisher 

I work with the GIX team, where we develop the nns-dapp.

I'll take note of that. We could show the checkbox but disable the action because the user doesn't have permission to do that.

-------------------------

lmuntaner | 2023-01-28 07:53:21 UTC | #80

Hi @dfisher 

Yesterday there was a new NNS Dapp release.

You should now see the Auto-Stake checkbox disabled for neurons controlled with hotkey.

Let me know if you have any issues.

Have a good weekend!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-01-28 10:48:46 UTC | #81

ORCA | 2023-02-25 02:46:48 UTC | #83

Hello!

Can you take a look at the ICdashboard neurons - the staked maturity is not being added to the staked ICP, thus, showing a lowered daily maturity reward.

Thank you!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-02-27 06:46:02 UTC | #84

@ORCA Thank you for pointing this out. 

Regarding showing only staked ICP: This is intended as the dashboard shows the stake in units of ICP (and maturity is not part of the public neuron info). Previously the dashboard showed incorrectly the sum of staked ICP and staked maturity as stake in ICP. 

Regarding the daily maturity reward: This is indeed a bug! See further information [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/important-dashboard-maturity-disappeared/18693/14). We expect a fix during the course of today.

Thank you for the follow-up. The ticket is still pending with the NNS engineering team, and I do not have an ETA yet. Item description "Support automatic re-staking of newly minted ICP by enhancing the future disburse maturity functionality. This would mirror the earlier merge function, but with the inclusion of a 7-day delay and modulation."

-------------------------

Roman | 2023-08-11 08:03:17 UTC | #90

Thanks a lot for you answer @bjoernek. 

I was asking this because I was curious about the moment when « disburse » won’t generate a neuron anymore, but will send the converted maturity *directly* to the main account (without a neuron acting as a medium). 

I guess it is included in what you call « enhancement of the maturity disbursing functionality ». 

Thanks again ! 🙏

-------------------------

smaug | 2023-09-26 20:07:57 UTC | #91

Any plans to allow a sliding scale for auto restaking, ie I could choose to automatically restake 50% of my maturity everyday?

Thanks!

-------------------------

bjoernek | 2023-10-03 03:14:19 UTC | #92

@smaug I am not aware of any plans for a restaking slider (I think this was not requested so far)
