Is there any way to get acces to [dfinityâ€˜s randomness](https://github.com/dfinity-side-projects/random-beacon) with Motoko? @chenyan @enzo

Summarizing the duplicate forum post  [here](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/usage-of-random-base-package/1668):

```
import Random "mo:base/Random"

...

    // 32-bytes of entropy.
    let beacon : Blob = await Random.blob();

```
