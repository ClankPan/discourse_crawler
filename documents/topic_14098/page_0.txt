Is this even possible? I was just curious what would be the process in case you suspect it is compromised and want to relocate your digital assets?
In other words is it possible to create a new Identity using the old one and move everything to that.
I would assume there would have to be some sort of barrier to this in order to make it more secure. This to me also seems kinda necessary to some extent.

Your questions make me cry from fear because It reminds me of "Terminator" films. I mean your questions, haha... 

But I think that this is possible.
