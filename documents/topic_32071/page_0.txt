I, as a big fan of ICP, i cannot understand why Difinity and other developers try to make building so complicated. People with no coding experience, shoud be able to make simple web page, a token, store data on chain or NFT collection WITHOUT CODEING. Building simple stuff shoud be done from browser. Has anyone even wondered why there is so low amount tokens and web pages on ICP, it is because allmost noone cares to learn coding, all those instructions are useless, 1 mistake on code and its over. 
If building/deploying is complicated for non coder, than no wonder why noone sees value on this tech. 
With lack of adoption, no matter how many canisters or wallets, if things continiue like this, we will surely see ICP price below 2 usd during bear market. 
All i ask is to make canisters with what people can deploy, build stuff from Browser onto ICP. (Has to be built by Difinity and no freaking 5-10 ICP fees) 
Right now allmost, **for ordinary people**, impossible to build/deploy token + figure out how even deploy onto dex with proposals. Make NFT collection and get it onto marketplace without needing to pay 50+ ICP, than finding out need cropping all pictures as thumbnails needed is different ratio.
I hope people understand what im trying to say. Onboarding developers is good, but you need people who actually use and see value in that.

Hi,

I appreciate your concerns about the complexity of building on ICP. I wanted to share that I’m working on a project called [B3Forge](https://sehgq-cqaaa-aaaap-ahc4q-cai.icp0.io/), which aims to simplify this process significantly. B3Forge centralizes all decentralized applications (dApps) into one platform, functioning akin to an App Store.

With B3Forge, users, including those without coding experience, can seamlessly connect canisters and build applications. Although B3Forge is still in its early stages, our goal is precisely to address the challenges you’ve highlighted and make building on ICP more accessible and user-friendly.

I invite you to check out our B3Forge [forum post](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/introducing-b3forge-candid-ui-seamlessly-integrate-and-customize-your-dapp-interfaces/30821) to learn more and share your thoughts on how we can improve to better serve the community.

Looking forward to your feedback!
