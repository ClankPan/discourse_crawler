Hey folks,

I am trying to install DFX but getting the following error in Terminal on Mac.

```
mkdir: /usr/local/bin: File exists
mkdir: /usr/local/bin: File exists
mkdir: /usr/local/bin: File exists
Will install in: /usr/local/bin
mkdir: /usr/local/bin: File exists
dfinity-sdk: Failed to install the DFINITY Development Kit: please check your permissions and try again.
exit
```

I am logged in as the only Admin user.

Any help appreciated.

Sounds like some folder permissions are whacky on `/usr/local/bin`. Have a look at [this SO post](https://superuser.com/questions/717663/permission-denied-when-trying-to-cd-usr-local-bin-from-terminal), maybe this helps.

No joy unfortunately. I wonder would a device reset work?

Maybe.

Assuming you tried `sudo`, you may want to check if there are any other processes that are using the `/usr/local/bin` directory. You can use the `lsof` command to list all the open files and processes that are using the directory.

Reset my Mac and seemed to work until I try begin coding.

After dfx start I get the following error : 

```
Using the default definition for the 'local' shared network because /Users/*******/.config/dfx/networks.json does not exist.
Dashboard: http://localhost:50245/_/dashboard
```

dfx version 0.12.1

I do not see an error in the output you show. Both lines are informational output that is ok to ignore.
