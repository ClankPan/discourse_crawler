After solving this by removing the [resepective properties](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/seed-round-access/2765/333?u=cryptoschindler) from Cargo.toml, those errors occured. How can we build this? I used both the stable Rust release and version 1.51 which is used for the Internet Identity.

@cryptoschindler this isn't fully ready yet, you might be seeing compiler failures due to local caching of cargo crates. Either way, can you delete this post? It's not ready yet.
