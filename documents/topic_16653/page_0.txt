* Where does Dfinity get money to finance its activities?
* How likely is it that Dfinity will run out of money and cease to exist?
* Does Dfinity disclose its income statement and balance sheet?

I'm asking because I don't want to end up in a situation where Dfinity announces its demise due to lack of funding.
