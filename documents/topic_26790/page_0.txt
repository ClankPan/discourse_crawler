Dear Internet Computer Community hello!

In recent months, I have embarked on a project of passion: the resurrection of an iconic Amiga game that left an indelible mark on my childhood. This game was not merely a source of entertainment but also a sophisticated business strategy simulator that provided players with a glimpse into the complexities of commerce.

With the advancements in blockchain technology, I see a unique opportunity to reintegrate this game into the modern digital landscape, specifically within the Internet Computer ecosystem. The objective is to not only rekindle the magic of the game for former enthusiasts but also to extend its reach to a new generation of players by bringing Real-World Assets (RWA) onto the blockchain.

My background lies predominantly in traditional industry sectors, from which I transitioned into the blockchain and cryptocurrency spheres. Although I have considerable experience as a user of gaming technologies, my expertise in the technical facets of game development, graphic design, and animation is not as extensive. However, I am committed to this project and i am discussing with the original development team of the game, who have expressed their enthusiasm for its further development and modernization.

We are in consensus that the game requires a contemporary graphical overhaul while maintaining the integrity of its engine, which already includes 3D elements from its later versions. However, the current gaming experience is restricted to peer-to-peer network interactions, and our goal is to expand this to a more robust and scalable blockchain-based multiplayer platform.

I am reaching out here to find individuals or teams with the necessary expertise in gaming, graphic design, and blockchain technology who are interested in joining this venture. Your skills and knowledge could significantly contribute to the success of this project.

If you are intrigued by this initiative and wish to contribute or know someone who would be ideal for this collaboration, I would be delighted to share more details and discuss how we can work together to bring this vision to fruition.

Please feel free to contact me to explore this opportunity further. I am looking forward to potential partnerships that can transform this vision into a groundbreaking reality.

thank you for reading!

I was hoping it was Speedball 2... but then I saw "business strategy simulator" :frowning:
