This article explains that staking rewards are taxed:

> According to the new IRS ruling, staking rewards are taxed at the time you gain dominion and control over a token. In simple terms, when you achieve the ability to sell, exchange or dispose of the coin, you have to pay income tax.
...
If you have staking rewards make sure to track them throughout the year. It is also important that you know the cost basis of each reward because it will go into your capital gains calculation if you sell the tokens.

What I'm not sure about is if you have to pay taxes on rewards that are *automatically* restaked using ICP's auto restaking maturity option.

Has the IRS released any guidance or policy on that?

Nah. Good argument to only count spawned icp.
