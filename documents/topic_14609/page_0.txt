Hi everyone,

our team has developed a couple of small but useful libraries for motoko [mofram-lib](https://github.com/caya-ventures/mofram-lib) :

https://github.com/caya-ventures/mofram-lib/blob/main/src/Cron.mo - easy to use cron with standard (almost :wink: ) syntax;

https://github.com/caya-ventures/mofram-lib/blob/main/src/DateTime.mo - functions to work with date and time;

https://github.com/caya-ventures/mofram-lib/blob/main/src/Array.mo - helper functions to work with arrays.

If you find it useful or have any suggestions on how to improve it or if you want to see more features here - feel free to open and issue or pull request.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Awesome work!  That date time one is particularly fantastic.
