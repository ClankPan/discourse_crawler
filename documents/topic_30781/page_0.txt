Hi there, 

Our team has been busy over the last few months building a coffee tracking app that uses the IC as a back-end. The purpose of the app is to collect data from coffee farmers in-field, as yields are harvested, and then aggregate this data at each point in the coffee journey. This is part of a broader traceability/insurance project that we have been working on called plural: plural.fi. 

The app also has a back-end dashboard which aggregates datasets across coffee farmers, and allows for sensor input as well. 

You can find out more here: https://youtu.be/SNwI9i7BX1Q. 

We'd welcome any feedback or questions. 

Thanks!

Just a couple of points regarding how the application is built for those that are curious: 

1. The app is designed as a PWA and you can find it here: https://coffeeflow.netlify.app. 

2. The front end is in React and runs on Netlify. We manage user log-in via an OTP sent to the user's phone. 

3. The back-end of the app is on the IC and the data is stored within a canister. Everything in the back-end is written in Rust. 

4. The dashboard is fully on the IC and uses geohashing/geosearch to aggregate data over locations. 

5. There are also endpoints for sensors to upload their data to back-end, and this data can be explored on the dashboard. 

You can find the dashboard here: https://ebjnu-4qaaa-aaaak-akrha-cai.icp0.io/
