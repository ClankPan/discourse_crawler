I want examples for the Motoko base library. I really don't know how to use some of the functions. Where can I get examples for the Motoko base library?. Can anyone help me?

There are tests that show how to call most of the functions in certain modules.  Not every module has a good test, but that's the eventual goal:
https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/tree/master/test

These examples just show the language and some uses of the base library throughout:
https://github.com/dfinity/examples/tree/master/motoko

And CanCan uses the base library quite a bit:
https://github.com/dfinity/cancan/blob/main/service/CanCan.mo

Especially in the utility modules here:

You might also find it handy to explore the actual files on your local machine too (open them in your IDE and search etc), see here:
