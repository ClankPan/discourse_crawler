Hey all, today [Psychedelic](https://psychedelic.ooo) is announcing **SLY**, an open source, friendly, and collaborative CLI tool for the IC.

SLY aims to be a streamlined and easy to use version of DFINITYâ€™s DFX CLI. Weâ€™ve also got plans to bring templates and a package manager (powered by the [DAB](https://dab.ooo) package registry) to allow for less cumbersome plug and play development of **Tokens, NFTs, and projects** on the IC.

For SLY V1 weâ€™re focused mainly on **improving the core developer experiences**. Some notable features include:

* Using Cycles Token (XTC) to abstract away wallet control
* Setting local canister IDs to match mainnet canister ID
* A Candid Toolkit (checker, parser, and source generator)
* Communications with canisters
* Identity management

Weâ€™d love to get some devs using SLY asap so we can get feedback to improve on this first iteration! Comment below if interested. To learn more about SLY read our announcement blog post, checkout our website, and visit our docsðŸ‘‡

Grateful for the effort that went into this. 

Out of curiousity, why not direct this effort into improving the **developer experience** on existing tools such as **dfx** and **vessel** that Dfinity maintains. That would lead to lesser fragmentation of the developer tooling ecosystem and lesser confusion for newer developers.

I imagine the rationale for building this would be so that, in the future, you can incorporate Fleek hosting into these tools as a 1-click easy alternative to deploying directly on the IC and monetize these efforts. But I believe that should still be possible with extensions to the Dfinity maintained tools.

Apologies if the interpretation seems off. Happy to be corrected.
