Today's average person will not be drawn to the complexities of Web3 and decentralization when their needs are already being met by existing Web2 platforms. 

However, the universal appeal of music opens a new gateway. While there are limited options like TRAX, which offers subscriptions to specific artists, it struggles with user engagement and does not fully leverage the potential of Web3 technology. What I know for certain is that people will come to the internet computer to listen to AI Music.

The AI HUB Music Discord, with its 600,000 members, has begun restricting music uploads due to DMCA concerns. **In fact AI HUB first amassed 500k+ members in early October and was then deleted after repeated copyright violation claims.** If you join the now, it is a lot of 'regular' people unfamiliar with how to even navigate discord but they're eager to be sent the latest 'AI Drake' to their DMs. This is one of dozens of AI Discords, which users number into the millions.

"Heart on my Sleeve", one of the first AI Songs to have gone viral, has amassed over 100 million plays to date -10 million coming within the first 24 hours-  across various platforms through official and unofficial uploads, highlighting the popularity AI-generated music among regular Web2 users.   

As a music enthusiast, I've joined many in exploring the internet for the latest AI mixes. However, maintaining a playlist is challenging, as platforms like SoundCloud and YouTube often remove tracks after they reach 30,000 plays. There is a lot of AI Music out there and just as quicky it goes up, it quicky gets scrubbed.

AI music is currently to thriving in the most obscure corners of the internet, drawing an estimated 1 billion weekly plays and potentially missing out on $4 million in streaming revenue. What is not being tracked are all the .mp3 files being shared among discords and messages to friends - which is how I first came to be one of many millions scouring the internet looking for the next AI hit.

The reason it is so difficult to find AI Music is due to the fact AI Music exists in a legal grey area and streaming services (SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music) doing the big record labels bidding for them.

Only 14 U.S. states have established publicity laws, leaving a federal void.  See https://hls.harvard.edu/today/ai-created-a-song-mimicking-the-work-of-drake-and-the-weeknd-what-does-that-mean-for-copyright-law/ and https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/ai-generated-music-is-everywhere-is-any-of-it-legal#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Copyright%20Office%20only,lines%20are%20already%20being%20drawn 

There currently is no centralized or decentralized place to upload, save, and distribute AI music. ICP is ripe to capitalize on this - traditional streaming services will abide to requests from the big music labels, however, there is no legal reason for them to do so currently. The music can be stored onchain and no central authority can take it down. 

Our canisters are around 80% complete and front end around 60%.

We're looking for feedback and those passionate about bringing this project to life. 

Thanks!
