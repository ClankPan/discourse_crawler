Getting this warning as below when i build

> Hex.mo:48.17-48.30: warning [M0154], field unwrap is deprecated:
> Option.unwrap is unsafe and fails if the argument is null; it will be removed soon; use a `switch` or `do?` expression instead

> Hex.mo:51.27-51.39: warning [M0154], field append is deprecated:
> Array.append has critical performance flaws; use a Buffer, and Buffer.append, instead.

Is there any sample for the how we can use do? instead of Option.unwrap and Buffer.append instead of Array.append 

Thank you

Hey @gladguy,

For the first question on handling options, please have a look at the reference here: https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/overview.html#_options
There's an explanation of handling options witch switch/case and below is an explanation of option blocks  `do ? { }`. 

Concerning `Array.append` and `Buffer.append`, an example to work with Buffers generated from Arrays would be the following. However, it would be good if someone with more Motoko experience could comment

```
let array1 = [1,2];
let array2 = [3,4];

let buffer1 = Buffer.Buffer<Nat>(array1.size());
for (entry in array1.vals()) {
  buffer1.add(entry)
};

let buffer2 = Buffer.Buffer<Nat>(array2.size());
for (entry in array2.vals()) {
  buffer2.add(entry)
};

buffer1.append(buffer2);
```

Thereâ€™s also some example usage for Buffer here:
[https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/blob/master/test/bufTest.mo](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/blob/master/test/bufTest.mo)

And some examples of do? with a little explanation:
[https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/control-flow.html#option-blocks](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/language-guide/control-flow.html#option-blocks)
and (as linked above):
