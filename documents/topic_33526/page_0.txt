[cycleops.dev](https://cycleops.dev/app/personal) shows amounts of memory used by canisters.

How is this at all possible, when the memory is just bytes. How does it determine which bytes are used and which no?

Also, if memory is freed (e.g. deleting an entry in a BTree), will this increase shown free memory?
