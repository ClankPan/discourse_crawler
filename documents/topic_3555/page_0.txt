I know, this is not top priority but really wanna ask: can we get rid of those semicolons? ðŸ˜‚ 

Currently semicolons is required everywhere, it's really a pain in the ass. I shoot in my own foot so many times while writing motoko app (and now I'm excessively adding semi everywhere for precautionary purpose).

Or, if you guys can ship a code formatter, like `gofmt`, I can live with it. Desperately need one!

Yeah its really annoying haha. I agree.

I agree that semicolons can be annoying, but I'm afraid the problem is that they usually distinguish two perfectly valid parses, so they're not just noise. For example,
```
f(4)
(5)
```
is already valid code, meaning `f(4)(5)`. Similarly for most other cases. So allowing to omit semicolons would be a breaking change, and one that introduces ambiguity for which it is unclear how to resolve it.

One example how not to do it is JavaScript: its "ASI" (automatic semicolon insertion) rules are a big hack and a reoccurring pain point when trying to extend the language -- I don't remember how many times some nice syntax proposal had to be tossed because it wasn't backwards-compatible due to ASI. It's also been the source of some hard-to-spot bugs in apps.

A much cleaner solution is how Haskell does it, but its approach is based on a completely different role for braces and semicolons that won't work with C/Java-style syntax used for Motoko.

Maybe there's still a way to introduce an ISWIM-style offside rule, but it's not obvious.
