Hello everyone,Now I have A problem, I dynamically created B Canister and C Canister with A Canister, and then I set B Canister as publisher, C Canister as subscriber, The Publisher/Subscriber pattern is used for messaging, but currently dfinity does not seem to support dynamically creating a message subscription pattern between Canisters.
