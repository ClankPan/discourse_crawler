I'm facing the same issue when I `dfx deploy` than when I `dfx generate`. Looking forward to the answer to the latest in the other [thread](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/dfx-generate-import-service-unexpected-token/27037) but here my question is why does dfx compiles the did files when I deploy? If there is a good reason, is there a param to skip it?

Actually, I don't care. Nvm this question.

Not always, but if the local did file contains init args or `import`, dfx have to compile the did file to perform some rewriting before storing the did file into canister metadata.
