Why does it try to use wallet? I want it to deploy using Ledger instead.
```text

```text
$ dfx deploy --network ic -v --no-wallet

Caused by: In order to create a canister on this network, you must use a wallet in order to allocate cycles to the new canister. To do this, remove the --no-wallet argument and try again. It is also possible to create a canister on this network using `dfx ledger create-canister`, but doing so will not associate the created canister with any of the canisters in your project.

I did set `DFX_CYCLES_LEDGER_SUPPORT_ENABLE=1` in `.env`. This does not help.

`export DFX_CYCLES_LEDGER_SUPPORT_ENABLE=1` is the way to go, either in the terminal or in a dotfile. dfx does not read this variable from `.env`
