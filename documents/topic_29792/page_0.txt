I have a prod and staging environment on my IC project. Some of the canisters in my project are dependant on one another.

So lets say i have a storage canister and a trading canister the trading canister needs the canisterID of the storage canister I can either hard code both the prod and staging canister id of the storage canister into my trading canister and tell it which one to use depending on a deployment argument e.g. environment which can be a variant of either staging or prod...

or i could pass the canister ID as a deployment argument  


Has anyone found a nicer way to do this using .env or something idk. Just looking for inspiration I can't be the only one with this issue.

There is [`ic-cdk-bindgen`](https://crates.io/crates/ic-cdk-bindgen), which can do some of the work. There is a toy project [here](https://github.com/dfinity/cdk-rs/blob/main/examples/counter/src/inter2_rs/build.rs) from which you can copy, or [this](https://github.com/bjoernek/multi_chain_voting/commit/d30dc662cf3c93ae494cf3843731592314866cd9) and [this](https://github.com/bjoernek/multi_chain_voting/commit/4740c9382b6f6452b5587cc2696f6dee62c0809d) PR where I included it in a live project recently.

It's currently underdocumented, but maybe you can figure it out?
