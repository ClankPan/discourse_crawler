Hi
I have been playing with the local internet identity canister.

My dapp has multiple pages = a.html, b.html, c.html, ..., z.html
I ran into a problem when I was testing the navigation. It seems that when I login as user A on page B, then navigate to page C, logout, and login as user D, but when i click "back", page B still thinks i'm user A, and this is messing up the identity that I'm passing to my actors. Was Internet Identity designed for 1-page dapps only? 

I use `onpageshow` event to run `await authClient.isAuthenticated()` and `authClient.getIdentity()`.

the error

I'm out of ideas on what to do next.

Can you try to set `authClient = null` after `logout`. Does it help?

Typically something I do on my state to prevent issue with the "sign in -> sign out -> sign in again" flow when the window is not reloaded.

thanks peter, it works! Looks like the `authClient` is exclusively for 1 user at a time only.

Out of the box, I think so. However I believe it may possible to have multiple instances of the client by passing a custom `storage` object in the constructor. However, even if this is the case, it would still be useful to reset each instance after logout. I'm glad it worked out!
