When I try to make an HTTPS outcall request from a canister to a Supabase Edge Function, I encounter the following error:

`HTTP request failed with code SysTransient: Connecting to afdzgpdiqcjkdsboeoml.supabase.co failed: Failed to directly connect: error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Network is unreachable (os error 101)`

I believe this issue might be related to IPv6 connectivity. However, as far as I know, Supabase generally provides IPv6 support without any additional configurations.

Does anyone have any insights on this issue?

This seems to be related to IPv6 connectivity.

You can check if the endpoint has IPv6 connectivity by checking for IPv6 dns entries.

In your case it doesn't show any records.
```
dig AAAA afdzgpdiqcjkdsboeoml.supabase.co
```

Checking IPv4 shows some ips 
```
dig afdzgpdiqcjkdsboeoml.supabase.co
```

Thanks for your reply.
I want to scan some apis from canister.
but as you know most of off-chain services doesn't provide IPv6.
So I want to make proxy to convert IPv6 to IPv4.
Request: Canister -> Supabase -> Destination service
Response: Canister <- Supabase <- destination service
How can I do this?
