Maybe pornsites on ICP is a thing already? Great way to attract more people to use the Internet Computer. People loves porn!

I totally agree. One of the problems why people are reluctant to pay in these places is the lack of anonymity. This should be big.

Porn isn't a useful content on ICP. I'd rather see them bring in global politics.

Im happy to see this thread caught some attraction. Indeed if people can view porn totally annonymous this will for sure attract more ICP buyers.

I just bought a fair amount of ICP myself with dissolve delay on 8 years! now if I only could spend my rewards on premium porn videos!
