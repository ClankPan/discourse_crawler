When I try and run the "reverse" C example, I get this. Any suggestions please?

The wallet canister on the "local" network for user "default" is "rwlgt-iiaaa-aaaaa-aaaaa-cai"

You could try clearing the replica cache with `dfx start --clean`

Also, which OS are you running this on?

I'm running on Ubuntu Linux
restarted with "dfx start --clean" and got the following: 

./start.sh

Hello! 
same issue on Fedora31.
dfx start --clean does not help.
No such file or directory.. I copied the reverse.wasm in several different subfolders but no luck.
Also the command that fails is the "install".

** BREAKING **

issue solved. make sure you create the subfolder:
.dfx/local/canisters/reverse
and copy the reverse.wasm into it.

cheers.
