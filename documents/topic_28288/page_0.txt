I might not have the exact figures (please correct me if I'm wrong), but towards the end of last year, the staking rewards for an 8-year period were approximately 16.1%, and now they seem to have decreased to 15.6%. I understand that the annual inflation rate should remain relatively constant, and because it is distributed among participants if more people engage in staking, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) received by each Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) holder would decrease. Is the staking percentage increasing rapidly?

Rewards are independent of the amount that's staked now. (Wasn't like that at the beginning). Rewards decrease until 8 years after genesis. Have a look at 'Voting Rewards Function' [here](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/circulation)

Just a clarification, the voting rewards that a neuron gets are now independent of the *voting behavior* of the other neurons.
The voting rewards depend on the total voting power, which increases as more ICP is staked.

As @Severin said, the voting reward function explains the reduction.
You can play with the [NNS Neuron Sandbox](https://klgza-cqaaa-aaaak-qcz5a-cai.icp0.io/) to get a better understanding of the reward mechanism!
