In the process of using the candid UI, 'could not be authenticated' is often prompted. When we use the candid UI API, is there a more convenient way to authorize?

Where does this error come from, in your dapp or from the IC? We haven't implemented the integration with II yet. But if you want to get the same identity as your real application, it can be difficult. Because for II, it's a different URL, thus you will get a different identity.

If you want to write some test based on identity, you can try [ic-repl](https://github.com/chenyan2002/ic-repl). It has an `identity` command, which can either generate random identities or import from an existing pem file.
