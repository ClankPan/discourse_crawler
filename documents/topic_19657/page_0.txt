First time deployments require 100_000_000_000 Cycle to create an empty canister. The second deploy is cheaper because it does not require the creation of an empty canister.

```
$ dfx deploy --network ic
$ dfx deploy --network ic
```
- Where is the cost of the second deployment deducted from? Are there any documentations? I could not find it.
- Does the cost of deployment depend on the size of the WASM or the size of the status?

You can see a list of all cycles costs [here](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/gas-cost).

When the canister is created, it costs 0.1T cycles, plus however many cycles you add to it. From then on (even the first `dfx deploy`), every cycle is deducted from the canister you're deploying to. The cost depends on WASM size (because every byte you send to the IC costs a little bit, called 'ingress byte reception' in the table), plus the amount of computation you perform in `init()` or `pre/post_upgrade` (see 'Ten Update Instructions Execution' in the table)

Thank you for your reply.

I see! I did not know that.
