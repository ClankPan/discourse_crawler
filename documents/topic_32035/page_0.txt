In the future, if we see the price of ICP continue to rise, how are people supposed to gain meaningful rewards and VP as the price of ICP grows?

Early investors certainly have the advantage of being early which makes sense because they face more risk than later investors in terms of perceived continued success but doesn’t this disadvantage later investors who want to participate in governance? They will have a significantly harder time getting the same levels of VP as today. How will this effect the network in the long run?

Well, this is how it's supposed to work. Earlier, Bitcoin miners mined Bitcoin with regular laptops. Early birds get the worms. This is fair. Is it a concern that this will cause some centralization? Sure, but it can't be helped.

This is true. I didn’t think about it that way but you’re right.
