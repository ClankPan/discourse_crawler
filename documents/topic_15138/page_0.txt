I remove the identity principal from the controller list of my canister. Now the controller is only a cycle wallet.
How to delte the canister now? I can't use dfx canister delete because the local identity is not the controller now.

You can proxy any canister call through your wallet by using `dfx canister --network ic --wallet <your wallet id>` and then using the subcommand as usual
