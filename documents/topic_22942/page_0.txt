Is there a list of all the optimisations that `dfx build` is applying to reduce the size of the produced wasm file? 
When I build with `dfx build` I receive a wasm size of around 1.9 MB but if I run the same build with `cargo build`, I end up at 3.7 MB (which is too large to upload to IC as >2MB). How can I find all the optimisations that `dfx` is applying?

dfx uses `ic-wasm` after `cargo build` and adds the .did file to the custom sections. I don't think it does anything else

ic-wasm repo ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm/](https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm/)

in II custom build they use `ic-wasm` as following ðŸ‘‰ [https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/0b58ec9dcba3a7ff73a51d5fa1851cb3205c3822/scripts/build#L134](https://github.com/dfinity/internet-identity/blob/0b58ec9dcba3a7ff73a51d5fa1851cb3205c3822/scripts/build#L134)
