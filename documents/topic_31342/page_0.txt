I was able to retreive my legacy OGY from the NNS and send it back out to another wallet. Let me know if anyone needs help.

It's not that I don't trust you, but given that the forum is sometimes visited by scammers and this is your very first message from a brand new account, I would advise anyone landing here to first take a look at the two following discussions in which both ORIGYN and DFINITY foundation members are active:

- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/ogy-icp-transaction-gone-wrong/31311

- https://forum.dfinity.org/t/lost-ogy-origyn-tokens-while-transferring-from-sonic-to-nns-dapp/31210/9
