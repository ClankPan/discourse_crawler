Hello, everyone! 

I am seeking to form a team for the upcoming Encode Hackathon and am seeking 1 to 3 individuals to join me. This is a fantastic opportunity for those who are passionate about technology and innovation. If you're someone who is full of ideas and has a keen enthusiasm for bringing them to life in a collaborative environment, I would love to hear from you. We will be working together to turn our collective ideas into a reality. If you're interested in being a part of this team, please send me a direct message. Let's make something amazing together!
