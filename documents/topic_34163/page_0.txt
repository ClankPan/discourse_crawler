Hello All,

Is there a way of making a catch-all canister method?  For example
```
/// Handles any update call, regardless of function name
#[update]
async fn __catchall(method_name: &str, args: CandidArgs) -> CandidArgs {
   println!("User called method '{method_name}'");
}
```
The use case is a proxy canister, that takes any update call and passes it on to another canister and returns the response the selfsame way, without having to know all the methods on the upstream canister.
