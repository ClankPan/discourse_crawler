On January 24th at 1900 UTC, the DFINITY Platform and Dashboard team will perform rolling upgrades on the ICP Dashboard infrastructure.  Users may experience short downtime windows, minor errors, and potentially delayed transaction indexing for approximately 6 hours.  Impacted resources include the Ledger API, IC API, SNS API, and the ICP Dashboard User Interface.  It's important to note that this will not impact the Internet Computer, ICP Transactions, Governance, or other IC-related processes.  

Maintenance will begin on January 24th at 1900UTC and will finish on January 25th at 0100 UTC.
