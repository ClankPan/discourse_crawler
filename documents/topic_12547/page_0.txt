I'm wondering how you develop features that require payments with ICP locally? If I'm not mistaken this would require a copy of the ledger running locally on my machine since their is no live testnet like in Ethereum, right?

I've looked around in the Github but didn't find it. Could someone show the directions please?

hey…relax it’s the weekend…take it easy…what ever fuck up ( or maybe not) you think you made is already done. Just take your Girlfriend or Boyfriend out for a drink, get a massage or something. stop watching CMC. you are not going to influence anybody in this forum. Smart people hang around here!
