Hello,

I worked through the whole dfinity defining an actor tutorial. 

got to the end and went to send the query with 

dfx canister call --query actor_hello hello   

but the only response I got back was closed parentheses.

()

I was under the impression it would say 'debug.print: Hello, World from DFINITY'
 
Any idea what I've done wrong here? There's no error callback so this is a bit difficult to debug.

Thanks!

Hi, welcome! 

The debug print outputs to whichever terminal you ran `dfx start` in. If you wanted to get a return value youâ€™d need to have the function in your Motoko code return the text and have a return type `async Text`. The other tutorials will go through this for you.
