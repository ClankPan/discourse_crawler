I get some weird problem when I use dfx SDK. "The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 500 Internal Server Error, content type "", content: Internal Server Error", I often receive this error. Usually happens after I re-deploy the project locally. Sometimes restart the dfx network will fix this, and I have tried reinstall dfx , delete the .dfx document...... But this problem always occurs intermittently.

Sometimes I get this error under similar circumstances. These problems always appear from time to time, and I donâ€™t know how to solve them

I was also getting the same error message as "The replica returned an HTTP Error: Http Error: status 500 Internal Server Error, content type "", content: Internal Server Error". 
Then I tried restarting my MacBook and It got resolved.
