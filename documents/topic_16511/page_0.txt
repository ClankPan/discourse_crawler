the candid web UI is awesome :smiley:
can I get a button there that just generates the code I need to import into my project for interfacing faster?
Sorry if I'm misunderstanding the process.

A step by step guide to integrating any bodies public canister functions would be very much appreciated :grin:

Not sure if you want to call an external canister in browser, or need a way to draw the UI for that canister method. For the former, you can see this release notes: https://github.com/dfinity/sdk/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#feat-remote-canister-support. For the latter, we don't have a fully baked solution. But you can call [renderInput](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/blob/main/packages/candid/src/candid-ui.ts#L207) function from `@dfinity/candid`, which takes a JS binding of the method type, and returns the DOM elements that corresponds to the method type.

Thank you for the information :smiley:
At the moment I'm looking into Motoko backend inter-canister calls.

Both backend and frontend guides for this in the docs would be much awesome :grin:

We have a guide here: https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/candid/candid-howto.

The JS binding part is a bit out-dated, I will update it next week.

Thank you.

Is there anything on interacting with external canisters through Motoko?

All I have is an external canister ID
no integration code
and I'd like to have my Motoko backend code call public functions on that external canister

what next?

Does this help?

Very helpful much appreciated :grin: Thank you!

I'm excited about how much more there is in this repo already

@claudio 
:slight_smile: please consider making the actor_reference example feature complete

including how to define query's, complex methods, error handling, etc
within the actor

```
get_location : query() -> async { x : Nat; y : Nat };
get_number_of_items_at(x: Nat, y: Nat) : async Nat;
```

at the moment I'm just trying stuff to avoid errors :sweat_smile:
