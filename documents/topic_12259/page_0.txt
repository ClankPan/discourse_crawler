**Supernova, the **First Global Internet Computer Hackathon****

hello; feel like having BigMap ready is fundamental.
as a dev it would be awesome to build on a layer that scales infinitely :smiley:

will there be an officially supported upgrade path? 

are there plans for this data layer to be invisible to devs running under our code as part of the platform layer instead of us directly interfacing with new data objects?

Why not build it for the hack-a-thon?  You'd win.

machine learning for engineering problems... so wouldn't meet the deadline... 

any rules against using a centralized database service like Firestore?
