When executing the command:
dfx canister --network=ic install --mode=upgrade 'canister'
An error occurs:
```
Error: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
Caused by: Failed while trying to deploy canisters.
  Failed while trying to install all canisters.
    Failed to install wasm module to canister 'rbac'.
      Failed during wasm installation call: The replica returned a replica error: Replica Error: reject code CanisterError, reject message Canister se3xx-ziaaa-aaaan-qdsta-cai trapped explicitly: Expiry time is in the past, error code None
```
Need to completely reinstall the code to update
