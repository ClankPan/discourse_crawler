Roughly ten days ago, the cycle burn rate chart on the dashboard indicated 122bn cycles/s. This now cannot be seen on the chart regardless of the timescale selected.

DFINITY, what happened to that? Was it another glitch (I seem to recall similar a few months ago)?

Thank you.

The underlying data hasn't changed. A `7D` chart will show a data point for every 10 minutes. A `1M` or longer chart will show a data point for each day. Due to the way that the data is queried and averaged, spikes may be smoothed out, especially for date ranges greater than `7D`.
