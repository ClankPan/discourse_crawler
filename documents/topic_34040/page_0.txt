Hi, Everyone!

I'm Seva, CTO of [Bridge23](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/bridge23-app-showcase/33926/4)

We won a few hackathons, closed a few milestones and got a few grants. Now we are moving towards SNS and want to get additional funding from friends, family and seed investors in order to finance our growing dev team

We would like to give them something in return and want to pre-mint our entire token supply and give them tokens.

The question is, if let's say we give away 5M out of 100M token supply, will we be able to use the rest (95M) of ICRC-1 tokens to launch on SNS?

I read the guide for SNS launch and am under impression that token should be created at the same time as we launch SNS. Am I wrong? is it possible to mint token and use it before the main SNS launch?

Hello Seva!

So the short answer is yes!
There is a swap dapp 

https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp

That can be used to swap your ICRC1 for sns tokens. We believe @Dogmi has done a similar thing. 

Good luck with your SNS!
