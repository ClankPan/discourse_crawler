**I. Introduction**

The Middle Ages was a period of so-called feudalism, a system of classes that built up society. Nobles were rich landowners who were in charge of administration and growth. The poorer people (according to materialistic wealth), typically peasants, lived on the lands of the nobles. They were granted protection and safety but had to provide goods such as wheat to their lords. The handle of a scythe, which was a common tool to cut grass or agricultural products like wheat, was called ‘snǣd‘ or ‘sneed‘ in Old English. Over time, in Germanic regions, the verb ‘to snede’ was commonly associated with ‘to cut’, and in a broader sense, detached pieces of objects were also called ‘sneeds’. 
Even today, the German ‘schneiden’ and the Dutch ‘snijden’ reminisce about these old times.

The centuries since have marked significant advancements in societies, transitioning away from systems dominated by single entities and gradually moving towards democracy and decentralization of powers. Today, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) enable community members to collectively decide on common goals. Dfinity, a pioneer in decentralizing the internet itself (‘web3’), released in late 2022 a unique DAO concept — a blank canvas experiment. This DAO was to be purely community-driven, without any initial direction. 
It was called SNS-1.

The ICP community indeed gathered, began organizing groups, and investigated potential use cases for SNS-1. However, the blank canvas was eventually filled, with the beautiful image of a Draggin. As SNS-1 found its concrete mission in the development of a web3 MMO called Dragginz, the community needed a new opportunity to dream and innovate without constraint, another blank canvas. 
SNEED represents the return of this vision.

Drawing inspiration from the medieval concept of ‘sneed’ —symbolizing division and renewal— SNEED is a direct community response to its need for decentralized organization. Just as societies have moved towards greater democracy in decision-making throughout the years, SNEED is a ‘cut’ from the original vision of SNS-1, returning to the roots of decentralization.

The following pages will introduce the vision of SNEED, proposing advancements that build upon SNS-1 based on lessons learned and today’s landscape in web3.

By the community, for the community.

**II. Vision and Purpose of SNEED**

SNEED was born in the mold of the 'blank canvas' vision set out by SNS-1. SNEED is envisioned as a DAO that truly belongs to the community. It's a place where anyone can come forward with proposals, collaborate on dApps, and contribute to a growing digital ecosystem. What sets SNEED apart is its innovative approach to tokenomics and a self-sustaining tokenomics model, both designed to thrive on the Internet Computer and to ensure that the SNEED DAO can operate independently. The essence of SNEED's vision is to create an independent, decentralized community where a common consensus shapes the way and where every member has an equal opportunity to contribute.

SNEED is conceived as a spiritual successor to SNS-1, embracing its vision of being a blank canvas for the community. Building on this foundation, SNEED introduces an enhanced tokenomics model designed to enable self-sustainability for the DAO. This strategic enhancement ensures that SNEED not only serves as a platform for user-driven innovation and creativity but also maintains its operational autonomy, with a deflationary reward model for governance. The goal is to provide a space where the community can freely realize its visions, backed by a robust and sustainable economic model. The SNEED treasury governed by the SNEED DAO will be a potential source for independent funding of community projects and active governance (e.g., proposals to spread liquidity across DeFi platforms for economic robustness, etc.).

*Core Values of the SNEED DAO:*

• *Decentralization*: community-driven governance and decision-making.
• *Innovation*: Introduction of the Recursive Liquidity Loop (RLL) model, a novel approach to DAO tokenomics
• *Economic Self-Sustainability*: A self-sustaining economic model through strategic token burns and buybacks.
• *Community Empowerment*: Provides a platform for members to propose and collaborate on dApps, embodying the 'blank canvas' vision introduced by SNS-1.

**III. Tokenomics** 

At the core of the SNEED DAO lies the SNEED token, which serves for governance and payment. To achieve a self-sustainable tokenomics, a novel approach to liquidity pool management is herein proposed, the Recursive Liquidity Loop (RLL), which can be operated by the SNEED DAO.

*Recursive Liquidity Loop (RLL) Model*

Unlike in traditional automated liquidity pools, the RLL model is governed by a collective decision-making of the SNEED DAO, ensuring a dynamic and responsive approach to decentralized liquidity management:
• *Self-Sustaining Mechanism:* The RLL operates on a recursive mechanism where the trading fees generated within the pool are utilized to continually strengthen and sustain the liquidity pool itself. This model creates a self-reinforcing loop in three stages:
1. ICP rewards from the RLL are staked in an 8-year NNS SNEED community neuron, committing to the ecosystem's future and providing a stable financial base.
2. SNEED token rewards from the RLL are sent to a burn address, gradually reducing the total supply.
3. The maturity from ICP staking is used to purchase and burn SNEED tokens, converting short-term trade volume into permanent buyback and burn pressure for the token, closing the economic feedback loop
• *Community-Governed Decisions:* The utilization of the accumulated fees for token burns, buybacks, or reinvestment is democratically decided by the DAO members. This process ensures that the RLL's operations align with the community's consensus.
• *Flexible and Responsive:* Community votes can effectively guide the RLL's strategy, adapting to market conditions and DAO priorities.

*SNEED’s Novelty*

SNEED's approach to integrating staking, token burning, and buybacks is an innovative method of ensuring financial self-sustainability within a DAO. While these elements are not new to the crypto space individually, their integration, governed by community consensus and aimed at long-term stability, provides a novel twist on traditional tokenomics. It sets SNEED apart from other projects by emphasizing a sustainable, community-led economic model rooted in the principles of decentralization.

**IV. SNS Sale**

The SNS Sale is critical for the formation of the SNEED DAO, establishing a Service Nervous System (SNS) for SNEED and laying the groundwork for the DAO's operational framework.

*Pre-Sale Setup*

• *Creating the SNEED dApp Canister:* The SNEED Team initiates the SNS Sale by developing the "SNEED dApp" canister, forming the core infrastructure for DAO operations.
• *Securing Liquidity:* Approximately 1,000 SNEED (LP-SNEED) and 20,000 ICP (LP-ICP) are withdrawn from the main liquidity pool (LP) on ICPSwap to provide foundational liquidity for the dApp.
• *Transferring the Community Neuron:* An additional 600 ICP, mirroring the stake in the current 8-year SNEED community neuron, is transferred to the SNEED dApp.
• *Allocating Treasury Tokens:* A total of 2,000 SNEED (TREASURY-SNEED) from the DAO treasury and another 1,000 SNEED (SALE-SNEED) are designated for the sale’s execution.
• *Developer Tokens:* Additionally, 900 SNEED (DEV-SNEED) from developer wallets are set aside to be exchanged for 900 SNEED as part of the post-sale governance plan.

*Conducting the Sale*

• *Handover to NNS:* After preparation, control of the SNEED dApp is transferred to the NNS to initiate the SNS Sale.
• *Token Distribution Management:* The NNS oversees the SNEED token distribution, offering 1,000 tokens for public purchase, designating 8,100 tokens for the DAO treasury, and allocating 900 tokens to the developers.
• *Launchpad Sale:* a total of 1000 SNEED tokens will be offered to the launchpad with a minimum of 10k ICP and a maximum of 20k ICP to be raised.
Contingencies and Proceeds
• *Sale Failure Scenario:* Should the SNS Sale not meet its objectives, control of the SNEED dApp reverts to the SNEED Team.
• *Successful Sale Outcomes:* In case of a successful sale, the NNS will formalize the SNEED SNS, transitioning control and resources to the new treasury and recognizing the contributions of both the development team and buyers.

**V. Post-Sale Governance and Token Management**

• *Reinforcing DAO Principles:* 
Post-sale, the SNEED Team will propose a series of actions: 
- Burning surplus SNEED (old) tokens, including 2,000 TREASURY-SNEED, 1,000 SALE-SNEED, 900 DEV-SNEED, and approximately 1,000 LP-SNEED.
- Creating a 1:1 conversion pool for SNEED (old) to SNEED (new, SNS) for current holders, with a significant portion of SNEED (new) from the SNS Treasury allocated to it.
- Initiation of RLL proposals by the development team.

• *Long-term Ecosystem Health:*
Proposals to establish new liquidity positions on decentralized exchanges, and to create a new 8-year neuron, will be introduced to secure the DAO's enduring financial stability.

• *Reward Distribution:* 
In a non-inflationary approach, the SNEED development team will propose that the SNEED or ICP collected from the RLL will be distributed to SNS stakers as a reward for their governance participation.

*SNEED SNS Parameters*

The DAO will operate under the following parameters to encourage participation and ensure a fair, decentralized governance process:
• *Token Minting:* An initial mint of 10,000 SNS SNEED tokens will mark the beginning of the SNEED DAO.
• *Reward Policy:* Zero additional SNEED tokens will be minted as rewards for stakers or voters, aligning with the non-inflationary tokenomics.
• *Staking Durations:* A voting power bonus will be set depending on the staking duration, with the option for stakeholders to commit for up to 100 years for the maximum bonus of 100%. The minimum staking duration to be able to cast votes will be 1 months initially.

**VI. Roadmap and Development Phases**

The SNEED DAO roadmap is structured to transition from launch to a secure, self-sustaining DAO:

*Short-Term Goals*
• Complete the SNS Sale and establish governance protocols.
• Initiate token burn and buyback mechanisms to be governed by the DAO.

*Mid- to Long-Term Goals*
• Maintain smooth DAO operations and active community governance.
• Achieve the ‘blank canvas for the community’ where independent developers from the ICP ecosystem can apply for funding from the SNEED DAO.
• Establish financial self-sufficiency for the SNEED DAO.

Come on SNS is for serious projects with an actual value stream creation.
SNS is NOT for meme tokens. Completely agains this initiative and I hope the community reconsiders this, as we are playing with the whole ecosystem credibility.

Are we going to permit more obvious RUGS? seriously?
Wake up guys.

The Sneed token launch appears questionable, with a notable red flag: 50% of the supply acquired by the wallet address responsible for creating the Liquidity Pool. Something seems off.

Sneed innovatively used the black hole code module, and Sneed has always honestly staked the LP profit into 8-year NNS governance. Both aspects are very positive. It is worth encouraging such teams to continue to innovate and explore in the governance of SNS and the black hole mechanism.

This is my main concern. There should be clear value in a project requesting SNS. I like SNEED but I don’t know that I want to see a bunch of memes as SNS.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-11-25 17:11:57 UTC | #29

Scam or legitimate, if I’m understanding this correctly, the ICP Dao will be voting on whether we will allow SNEED to raise 20,000 ICP via the SNS and lock-it in an 8-year neuron. 
In those simplest of terms, I support the locking of 20,000 more ICP for 8-years. 

I do not own any SNEED. The SNS1 should have created a meme coin called Hemingway as I suggested here: https://forum.dfinity.org/t/sns-1-and-how-to-interact-with-the-sns-canisters/16811/32?u=dhemingway

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2023-11-25 18:10:40 UTC | #31

Please read the whitepaper.  Not a meme but a store of value / payment token disguised as a meme.  Already used for tipping.

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2023-11-25 19:29:18 UTC | #32

Let me be clear;
I am one of Roland Berger's consultants who is trying to sell the corporate solutions that IC can provide.
The NNS is the gateway for the maintenance and deployment of any application.
It is a showcase in which all the projects that come out determine the reputation of the businessman who decides to trust the IC to host some type of service.
Therefore, I implore the community to start being more selective with the projects they support. Projects that do not create any value, that only play with speculation and pyramid schemes harm the ENTIRE community equally.
If you believe in IC, rethink how you want the ecosystem to be observed. We must flee from the crypto world and position ourselves as what IC, innovation and technology, is.
SNEED IS NO PRODUCT, SNEED IS NOT TECHNOLOGY. SNEED SHOULD NOT BE THE SHOWCASE OF WHAT AN ENTERPRISE THINKING OF INVESTING IN THE IC SHOULD SEE.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-25 20:02:24 UTC | #33

I did read the white paper when it first came out. What’s the difference from being “disguised” as a meme and being a meme? What service does SNEED provide? What are they working on that requires them to crowdfund in this way? The only marginally useful thing mentioned here is 

[quote="Sneed, post:1, topic:24975"]
Achieve the ‘blank canvas for the community’ where independent developers from the ICP ecosystem can apply for funding from the SNEED DAO.
[/quote]

But even then we don’t even need this because this is what SNS’s are for anyway. Why do we need to go to SNEED when the SNS process already exists? I like SNEED but there is nothing valuable being proposed here. I’d take a Windoge SNS over SNEED if I wanted a meme SNS because at least they have a website that can do fun and interesting stuff. SNEED just sounds like a place for people to congregate and govern nonsense.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-11-25 20:05:19 UTC | #34

Imagine serious corp coins in the NNS wallet surrounded by GHOST and SNEED (and there are more with names a lot worse) It's a very valid concern that nobody in crypto including leading lists like CMC and exchanges has addressed - There is DOGE and SHIB next to Bitcoin and the Internet Computer and also a bunch of complete scams in top 100 nobody seems to be able to delete. 
I am not a fan of meme coins and I also wonder if they should be cut out completely, but I don't think the decision is mine to make considering there are so many of them. When it comes to ICPCoins I prefer the DAO to make that call once it's formed. Perhaps compromises can be made and meme coins can be placed in another tab or something similar. They are not competing with other serious projects anyway and shouldn't get mixed.

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-25 20:06:39 UTC | #35

The fact that you started this statement with “Scam or Legitimate” is equally concerning as it is telling. If you had a Known Neuron, I’d be sure to tell as many people as I could to not follow you.

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2023-11-25 20:13:25 UTC | #36

Agreed.
The thing is if people want to invest in meme i dont even care. But the NNS and the SNS is a very serious application that is actually the backbone of a multibillion proyect like the IC. It is for real world and enterprise applications, NOT for meme coins.
And the community should be very serious about it as a lose in confidence can make this project sink even more, now that things are coming together and we have an opportunity to show the crypto world that there are applications other than speculation.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-11-25 20:20:40 UTC | #37

On the flip side, SNS is both software that provides security and a list used in dexes, wallets, and dashboards. Even meme coins can benefit from the security part. It seems to be the practice. Ethereum didn't deny meme coins properly secured ledgers and contracts, leaving whoever bought them to be at the mercy of hackers. It's just the list part that probably needs to be split into two so they don't mix visually.

-------------------------

BIKETACO | 2023-11-25 20:44:20 UTC | #38

Even with only 'serious projects' and GHOST, the NNS is getting crowded in its first year of SNS sales.

I **love** the idea of a categorized redesign with tabs for different token types.

-------------------------

DHemingway | 2023-11-25 20:59:52 UTC | #39

I'm sure of two things in life, Scott Summers and ICP are the only things that are good locked-up. If we can lock-up 20K ICP from this launch, let's do it, yes from me. Although I won't participate in the SNS I do think tokens like this draw more people to the ecosystem and more investment into projects with more business focus & legitimate purpose. 
Tokens like SNEED are much needed for the IC as SHIBA is needed on the ETH network. 99% of tokens are a money-grab, but they are a part of crypto. So again, Scam or Legitimate it doesn't make a difference, it benefits the IC. I think your statement is also equally concerning as it is telling. If you had a Known Neuron, I'd be sure to tell as many people as I could to not follow you as well.

-------------------------

nolyoi | 2023-11-25 21:08:52 UTC | #40

>They are not competing with other serious projects anyway and shouldn’t get mixed.

It's quite obvious they are when they have more volume and have more liquidity than "serious projects"

> It’s a very valid concern that nobody in crypto including leading lists like CMC and exchanges has addressed 

To whom? You are ignoring the market demand for your own biases.

Lets do it. Shitcoin SEERS passed

-------------------------

ckMood | 2023-11-25 22:00:08 UTC | #42

Your outlook is very short-sighted in my opinion. 20,000 ICP is 0.00033% of the remaining supply of ICP on the market. The fact that you don’t care about the long term credibility of projects on the IC is sad to say the least but hey this is crypto 🤷🏾‍♂️. Also how will SNEED becoming a DAO draw people into the ecosystem when no one outside of ICP even knows what SNEED is. SNEED is a fraction of a fraction of people in the entire cryptocurrency space. You’re also conflating ETH’s model to the IC model. ETH does not have a platform like the SNS. If you read Dominic’s post on the SNS structure and what it’s for you’d know it’s meant for projects with at least some real utility which is not showcased in the original post at all. If we had categorization of SNS on NNS then maybe I’d consider it but still there is nothing useful being discussed here. If you can provide me with an actually useful thing that will come of this I’ll consider it but until then this is silly.

-------------------------

infu | 2023-11-25 23:14:56 UTC | #43

I disagree with the conclusion that market demand exists when it is solely based on a single metric without further validation through additional checks.

Wdym? Dogecoin has been around since 2011 and hundreds of others. How much more do you need? How many years and billions of dollars do you need to prove the demand to you?

-------------------------

nolyoi | 2023-11-27 17:23:16 UTC | #45

Seems like categories is just a waste of time and potentially confusing. If I make a meme coin that has some actual DApps, is it still a meme coin because it has some funny dog pictures or is it a serious project because it has some custom made dapps? Seems like these categorizations could get political. 

Would be easier to just let people select what they want to appear in the wallet and order them however they wish.

You're doing a great job. 👏

Another problem here is that by denying projects access to the NNS managed SNS, you're making them choose other potentially less secure routes to continue doing whatever they're doing. Is that really better for the users you're supposedly trying to protect?

Like trying to sell neurons, instead of just letting people do it, we make people hack their way around it to accomplish the exact same thing in a less secure manner.

We’ve seen examples of the use of the SNS infrastructure that were quite “interesting” to say the least from prior SNS DAOs. Providing this infrastructure at this early a stage in the ICP ecosystem is not a hedge against potential malintent.

"The threshold of Sns is specially designed for decentralized applications."For this motto, is it just a project dedicated to decentralized programs?I want to ask how many application tokens are in the crypto market.I think as long as community governance tokens can be used on sns, some people always like to promote themselves as tall.I don't have sneed. sneed's trading volume ranks first in icpswap in a short period of time, and I support it unconditionally.Governance tokens have become bigger, and everything unknown in the future will happen.
Don't live in the world of "maxims", wrap yourself in a cocoon…
@Dominic, come out and say something, what do you do?For example, can't a project that has no products but a strong community be used online?
Or, there are products, but there are no users, and there is no market just in demand. Can such a project go online?Because it meets the needs of products, it becomes a dapp on the line.

I don't understand your point because according to [ICPCoins](https://icpcoins.com/#) all the coins you're pointing to have higher market caps in the ICP ecosystem than SNEED at the moment so logically they're bringing more value to the network. They at least have real tangible products that can be used on the IC. There are other issues to be addressed with the other SNSs as discussed here: [!ONLY “1 ICP” IN ICX’S SNS ICP Treasury! What is the Warning!, the Reflection!, the ACTION! for us?!?!?!](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/only-1-icp-in-icxs-sns-icp-treasury-what-is-the-warning-the-reflection-the-action-for-us/23798). From this, based on what I've read regarding how things were done in these other SNSs Treasuries + the fact that there have been no solutions implemented on this yet makes me all the more wary to give a memecoin especially an SNS. I think it is better and looks better in the long term to those who use the NNS for there to be projects with use cases and tangible products as SNSs with it's current configuration (of having no categories of SNSs). I think in two years if there are 5-6 meme coins crowd the NNS, it just won't look good. 

Again I'd like to reiterate that SNEED's only point of value to the IC in this post is to offer something that we already have which is the very process that they are using. If there is something else of value beyond this I would like to hear it. Again it just sounds like a place for people to congregate to govern the LPs and funds of the project, nothing more nothing less. I'm sure there is a community, which we're not entirely sure how robust that even is, but what is this going to do for the IC as a whole?

People were also critical of IC GHOST wanting to be an SNS in the same way. How they got adopted I don't know but this is not a matter of favorites. More than anything I simply think to someone who is new to the IC and NNS this dilutes what the purpose of the SNS and Internet Computer is as the NNS is a very central part of the IC.

And for all you saying I didn't read the white paper and that SNEED is not a memecoin. You need to read it yourself:

From this, based on what I’ve read regarding how things were done in these other SNSs Treasuries + the fact that there have been no solutions implemented on this yet makes me all the more wary to give a memecoin especially an SNS.
[/quote]

You'd rather have them out in the wild building this type of stuff for themselves or launching app subnet SNSes instead?

How is the value or utility relevant at all unless funds are being asked for from the community fund? If people want to buy it or not thats their choice. But by not allowing it you're pushing them to less safe alternatives.

If I want to deploy an SNS on the SNS subnet without any involvement of the community fund, why shouldn't I be able to do that? The wallet is a bad excuse because you can show certain things by default, thats just a frontend problem.

 what some people are missing here is sns will have alot of projects that are not going to make it  sneed is a project that will make it for what sneed is a community builder / all the words i see here today is some people think they own the sns /the sns is for all projects use even the meme coins / we all made this community grow no matter you dont like a meme /your so called real projects are hiding from you   i say vote sneed in the SNS

-------------------------

 if you are worry about taking value from the community /sns stands for itself if sneed or ghost has sns coins people went to come to our community to become a part of our community just because of these coins you do not have a right to say coins can not have sns / your thinking is hurting us in the icp community in so many ways / we members of the icp community are glad there is a not alot like the guys that came to our community late with alot of advice just post to post   Dr Deeds

I recognize that everyone has the ability to vote. I know I do not own the SNS.  What I'm saying here could be of no consequence because it's ultimately up to what the community wants. I just want people to think about what it is they're voting in to have an SNS. The SNS infrastructure has not matured yet. The SNS infrastructure is not a perfect hedge against potential malintent. There are people here who don't think SNEED is a memecoin when it says it is. How diligently are people actually examining things or do they just want to see their favorite thing on the front page?

Dominic laid out what people should be looking for in an SNS proposal:

[quote="dominicwilliams, post:1, topic:19906"]
1. **Technology**. What is already running? Is it something we can see is compelling, because we can actually try it out!? Is this something with legs, which we would be proud to have running in a fully decentralized way as *part* of the Internet Computer blockchain in the mode of a protocol?
2. **Real users**. Does the project already have some reasonable number of users that helps *prove* its value? There are many projects on the Internet Computer that have significant numbers of users to choose from. Users provide proof that a project is viable and ready for the next stage.
3. **Tokenomics**. Projects that are fully decentralized require sustainable tokenomics. This is what will drive their micro-economies, bringing in new users, and helping them grow over the long-term. It is non-trivial to create working tokenomics. At the least, the project should be able to explain clearly the tokenomics that could be created using SNS governance tokens.
4. **Team**. Who are the engineers/entrepreneurs behind the project? What are their capabilities? Where can we actually *see* what they have built, because that’s the only real way of knowing they are capable of. Generally speaking, in the years I have been an entrepreneur, I have seen team after team that is convinced that if they were provided funding they could build something great, then falling on their face when they received funding. Building is hard. People give up or start arguing. They flame out. For these reasons, in my view, projects and teams should show they can build, and that they have the relentless determination required. People can build in their spare time. Single-minded developers and entrepreneurs get shit done one way or another, often without any funding at all, running on empty, and fueled with pure determination. These are the projects that become winning bets when afforded funding because it just helps them accelerate what is already working. This is something we need to require if we want to create a thriving decentralized economy that lights the way for the rest of crypto and Web3. Riskier bets should be the domain of grants, seed funding and VC (or VC-SNS) funding.
[/quote]

I respect SNEED wanting to be a community builder. It could be a form of the VC-SNS that Dominic mentions and perhaps that could work however SNEED has not presented itself as something to be taken seriously and so I don’t believe it is unreasonable to be skeptical of such a proposal. I think SNEED checks out in terms of “users” and tokenomics but the team and tech are absent. The way Dominic talks about future SNS projects he talks about them as the way in which I described of a project with a tangible product and visible team behind it. I’m simply voicing my opinion.

[quote="nolyoi, post:58, topic:24975"]
How is the value or utility relevant at all unless funds are being asked for from the community fund?
[/quote]

Value and Utility are always important especially with a concept like the SNS. If there are projects that offer no value then this harms the credibility of the SNS concept and dilutes its meaning.

Also I'm not sure I'm understanding your entire comment so if you could elaborate that'd be helpful.

[quote="Robert_Hon, post:57, topic:24975"]

[/quote]

You are correct the trading volume for SNEED is a bit higher although SONIC 24h Vol is not accounted for a lot of the coins so it's not as much of a discrepancy as ICPCins shows but it is there. I can't argue there.

Sneed | 2023-11-26 11:32:11 UTC | #71

The Sneed Team is thrilled with the lively response to our proposal! 

We are grateful and humbled by so many from the community showing their strong support! We want to emphasise that Sneed is an effort by the community, for the community. The proof is in the eating of the pudding, so seeing this strong engagement is profoundly encouraging. 

We also see several community members voicing concerns that should be addressed. 

The questions are mainly in two categories: specifics around our proposal, and concerns about the merits of the project in general. We will try to address both in this thread, but if it becomes unwieldy one option might be to break out the general questions into a thread of its own and use this one for the more specific questions (forum moderator advice welcome).

Starting with some more specific questions, let’s begin by clarifying the developer share.  
When Sneed was launched, the developers were allocated 1,000 SNEED, 10% of the supply. This is also the allocation they will end up with in this proposal. The proposed process is: 
1) At SNS launch the Devs are allocated 900 SNEED. 
2) Accordingly, 900 of the 1,000 old SNEED tokens owned by the Devs are burned (this is how they are converted into the new SNS SNEED). 
3) The Sneed Team creates a proposal to the SNS to create a 1:1 conversion pool from SNEED (old) to SNEED (new, SNS), and to send an amount of SNEED (new) to it that matches the amount of SNEED (old) in the market. 
4) The Dev Team can then convert their remaining 100 SNEED (old) to SNEED (new) via the conversion pool together with all other holders of SNEED (old). 

The rationale behind it is as follows: by allocating 900 rather than 1,000 SNEED from the SNS launch to devs, they should have enough votes to go ahead with the steps they have advertised they will take next, which is the creation of the conversion pool and sending SNEED from the SNS treasury to it, but they should not be unstoppable. 

It is unlikely that a saboteur would manage to acquire all 1,000 of the SNEED from the SNS sale, and thus be able to prevent the creation of the conversion pool (and be able to steal the treasury). However, if the Sneed Team tries to create a nefarious proposal during this period when they have an outsized vote, the community does still have the option of coming together to win the vote to stop them. By creating the conversion pool, the 1,000 SNEED from the SNS sale will quickly join the majority of SNEED that is already in the market, so that the Devs will no longer have anything like a controlling vote in the project.

The goal is the following end state: Devs have 1,000 SNEED, where 900 are locked up in neurons from the SNS launch, and 100 are liquid and available via conversion, which together represents 10% of total supply. 

Currently, the Sneed Team controls the following wallets:
Treasury wallet: 
https://sneed.one/?acct=auzum-qe7jl-z2f6l-rwp3r-wkr4f-3rcz3-l7ejm-ltcku-c45fw-w7pi4-hqe

This wallet currently contains 3,019 SNEED. 2,000 SNEED of those are reserved for the SNS Treasury. 1,000 SNEED of those are reserved for the SNS Sale. The method for converting these SNEED (old) into SNEED (new, SNS) is to simply burn them after the SNEED (new, SNS) have been minted. 
The 19 remaining SNEED are what is left of the almost 1,000 SNEED that were reserved for airdrops, which have been distributed as follows: 
https://icsneed.com/?airdrops=sneed

Dev wallets:

https://sneed.one/?acct=l2wou-xtapz-wfatn-ptq6w-v6yek-qshs5-qsy5a-tuixw-xbhq6-cimdp-xae
https://sneed.one/?acct=akbcy-jszkp-z6zfd-4md7k-xmdgr-p5stn-enzhm-47hpo-sxhps-aoyxt-bae
The dev wallets control the 1,000 SNEED that devs were awarded during the Sneed launch. 
Together with the treasury wallet this makes 4,019 SNEED in total, or 40% of supply. 

Then, the Sneed Team also controls the Sneed Team position in the ICPSwap Liquidity Pool (LP). Currently there are 670 SNEED in this position, and 14,844 ICP (so the estimates of approximately 1,000 SNEED and 20,000 ICP in the proposal above are in fact too large and will be corrected when the proposal is submitted). 

Together that makes about 4,689 SNEED controlled by the Sneed Team, or 47% of total supply. The rest are in the market, distributed via airdrops (almost 1,000 SNEED) and bought by users via the LP.

One important purpose of the SNS DAO formation is to change this so that only the 10% of SNEED allocated to the dev team is controlled by the Sneed Team. The Treasury and any liquidity positions should belong to and be controlled by the community, via the DAO. The SNEED reserved for the SNS sale should be distributed. 

Regarding for how long the developer neurons with 900 SNEED should be locked, we are interested in community input! Our thinking is that we want to find a balance between demonstrating commitment, but also not remaining an outsized voice of influence. That means we don’t want to lock for too short, but also not for too long. We have tentatively thought a locking period of around 1 year, or maybe a combination of locking some for 6 months and some for 1 year, might strike the right balance, but we would be very interested in hearing the community’s opinions. 

Next, we want to clarify that the purpose of the 1:1 conversion pool is to let all holders of SNEED (old) be able to convert their holdings to SNEED (new). The idea is to send a matching number of SNEED (new, SNS) to this pool as there are SNEED (old) circulating in the market, leaving the rest (minus the 900 SNEED to devs) in the Sneed SNS Treasury. This should end up with about 2,000 SNEED in the Treasury, plus about 670 SNEED or so from the LP. It would be our recommendation, but it will be up to the DAO to decide, to use the 670 SNEED together with the about 14,844 ICP from the old LP to create a new LP to provide liquidity and to allow the RLL to continue to operate as before. 

The SNEED distribution from all this would be: 10% to devs, 20% SNS Treasury, some 5-6% in an LP controlled by the SNS, and the rest is in the market.

As to the current operations of the RLL, they are not automated. The Sneed Team currently manually collects LP rewards, where the SNEED rewards are burned, the ICP rewards are staked into the 8y neuron, and maturity from the 8y neuron is collected and used to buy back and burn SNEED from the LP. The extent to which the DAO decides to automate these operations should reflect what parts of RLL mechanics it is interested in continuing with. 

Now to the more general concerns, “why Sneed?”. 

Let’s start by acknowledging that there exists a concept called “meme coins” that have mostly bad connotations. At worst, they are scams, at best they are meaningless vehicles for speculation based entirely on greater fool theory, void of any actual value much like a derivative without an underlying, that might in its most charitable form be described as a “casino”. 

Sneed is not a “meme coin” in this regard. Sneed is a utility coin, the theory of which will be expanded on below, meant to be useful for the community by finding a balance between utility for small payments and store of value, and by letting the community itself manage this balance. It is meant to be a coin with tokenomics designed to allow users to keep their tokens liquid, without losing out to minting dilution. 
Sneed does build part of its branding on the “Sneed” meme, in particular the specialized use of this meme inside the SNS-1 community, where “Sneeds” used to be a nickname for the token before the decision to rename it to DKP. The “meme” here is the “blank canvas” meme of the SNS-1 project, and an acknowledgement of the culture in the SNS-1 community. The word “meme” in its original definition (see R. Dawkins, The Selfish Gene, 1976) refers to a unit of cultural evolution, and this is how we should think of it here – Sneed continues the “blank canvas meme/concept” of SNS-1. 

That said, the disclaimer on the website states that Sneed is just a “memecoin”. This is because until the formation of a DAO that brings its treasury and tokenomics under decentralized governance, it doesn’t hope to be more. Only with the elimination of trust in the Sneed Team currently required by users can the token find its full utility, which is what we hope to achieve with this SNS proposal. 
 
So, one answer to the question “why Sneed” is that since the conversion of SNS-1 into DKP, there is currently a community without a club house, a DAO without a DAO – there is a need for a blank canvas DAO to take over from SNS-1, and Sneed intends to be that blank canvas DAO. 

It is not enough to say “SNS itself is the blank canvas”, because that would be to deny the sprawling vitality of the SNS-1 community which under the blank canvas banner spawned projects such as ICPCoins, became something of a launchpad for budding writers, for Sneed itself, and recently an innovative experiment called SpellKaster. SNS-1 was a fantastic and incredibly inspiring experiment for the community that got involved in it, and as SNS-1 turns into DKP we would like the experiment to continue, and to invite an even greater part of the ICP community to join in on the fun!  

Another answer to “Why Sneed” is that it is designed to fill a niche that is not yet filled, which is that of a deflationary payment coin, practical on the scale of use cases relevant to communities, such as tipping.
Bitcoin and Ethereum both have gas fees that make small payments such as tipping infeasible. Networks dedicated to the payments use case, conversely, never manage to find sustainable tokenomics. ICP provides a true revolution here. By creating a platform for serving full dApps, ICP can support a payment token essentially in its stride. The IC platform combines security, scaling, robustness and decentralization with cheap gas fees - and a reverse gas model! This is ideal for creating a useful payment token that inherits all these properties from the IC. 

But why not just use ICP for payments, payments with ICP also obviously have all those properties? Because ICP is fine tuned to a different use case, which is to pay for cycles in the IC and to govern it. Governance is so central to its purpose that big inflationary rewards are minted for it. This means that ICP is not really designed to be kept liquid, it makes more sense to stake. 

For this reason, there is a meaningful niche to be occupied by a token with tokenomics designed to make it useful for payments (cheap transaction fees, non-inflationary governance incentives) while inheriting the properties of the IC. 

We have designed the Sneed tokenomics to be heavily optimized for a useful community payment token, that is deflationary so users can keep their tokens liquid and ready for use in payments, not having to worry that their value is being diluted unless they stake their tokens. 

The RLL described in the proposal is designed to allow all Sneed holders to benefit from burns and buybacks, and to benefit governance with rewards from the RLL income streams to avoid having to mint any rewards. All of this is inspired and refined from the original SNS-1 tokenomics, which demonstrated the power of deflationary supply but never solved rewarding governance. 

So, the second answer to “Why Sneed” is that the IC needs a community governed payment token for community scale use cases (such as tipping), the value of which is not tied to the particular fortunes of any specific distributed application targeting a specific business domain, and where the tokenomics are designed to support keeping funds liquid. 

In the short time since its inception, Sneed has already enjoyed a fantastic reception from the community. 

An example of this is that it was the first token to be added to OpenChat’s tipping feature via SNS proposal. This feature has already been very popular and has increased the Sneed user base to a point where in just over a month since the October 20 launch, Sneed already counts over 24,000 transactions by over 1,600 accounts, with over 250 accounts holding at least 1 Sneed, 478 accounts holding at least 0.1 Sneed, and the biggest account after the treasury and dev wallets (and the ICPSwap trading pool) holds 310 Sneed. 
https://sneed.one/?top=all
We launched the Sneed token directly as an icrc1 token via LP instead of going straight for an SNS for several reasons. One was drawing on the lessons from SNS-1 where the SNS sale was marred by “botting”, i.e. bots buying up a significant part of the sale. By allowing the token to be traded in the market first, the incentive for botting is reduced and the SNS sale price can be informed by existing price discovery. 

Another important reason was to demonstrate the power of the RLL scheme in practice before the DAO. 

To date, in just over a month since launch, the Sneed RLL has used LP rewards to:
-	Burn over 29 Sneed (0.29% of supply)
-	Stake over 600 ICP in an 8y neuron
-	Buy back and burn 5 ICP worth of SNEED from the LP using yield from 8y neuron.

It will be up to the DAO to steward the Sneed tokenomics, but by demonstrating the RLL in practice we have given DAO members a good idea of how the concept works. 

The Sneed Team considers the token launch a convincing success, that clearly shows the interest in Sneed’s innovative concept. It should be noted that the ambition to continue the spirit of SNS-1 and the mechanics of the RLL have been communicated consistently, and so the great community engagement shown should be an indication of the community’s interest in the concepts Sneed proposes. 

In closing, we would invite you all to consider that the IC’s revolutionary properties do make creating tokens with attractive tokenomics and realistic online payment use cases feasible in a new way. 

An ERC20 “meme token” could never be useful for community scale payments, due to Ethereum’s gas fees, so it would be almost by definition without a real use case. Thus, on the Ethereum platform, it makes sense to be very skeptical of “meme coins”. 
But the IC community might be wise to not unthinkingly apply that lesson to the IC. The reality is that IC revolutionary properties allow for the creation of many types of useful tokens with slightly different tokenomics, targeting slightly different use cases – all of them potentially useful - and it’s just a fact of the crypto world that many of these will use memes as part of their branding. 

If we are too quick to disqualify all such efforts, we are in fact quick to dismiss one of the most fundamental value propositions of the IC. This, of course, does not mean that the IC will be immune to pure meme tokens that are truly devoid of real value, but just dismissing anything with a meme out of hand may be a mistake. 

The Sneed Team believes strongly that Sneed has the potential to grow organically into something valuable for the IC community as a payment token with store of value properties and decentralized governance - a combination that can only be realized on the IC. 

We want to thank the IC community for the great enthusiasm and engagement shown in the project, which is by the community, for the community.

 Memecoins certainly rub me the wrong way and I’m generally opposed to them in an infrastructure such as the SNS. However, SNEED does have an engaged community and I think what is being said here is worthy of some reconsideration.

It’s not about the world ending. It’s about the long term success of the IC and the credibility of the usefulness of the SNS infrastructure within the IC. Also, to my knowledge BOOM DAO (one of the few) did what they said they would do with their treasury and did not act out of accordance with it’s whitepaper. I would’ve liked this to have come about differently however. I don’t think that KYC is necessary to the degree we have to see photo IDs of people and such. I think there should be a combination of aspects similar to what is required for Node Providers and Known Neurons. SNS is for a product/service and we need to know that it can be delivered on and that there are people qualified in skill to make what is needed happen. While SNEED is proposing a unique community driven application there is no way to test it other than to put it place. There is nothing else that we can use as a benchmark for how it might go. Perhaps, the original SNS-1 is an idea of what could be but that doesn’t mean that it is fully applicable here. I also wasn’t in the IC when the SNS-1 was created so I can’t say 100% if it is or isn’t a good benchmark.

Think about it-

What's all the use of this amazing alien tech if the accessibility level is too high?

DAO'S on the IC are worked into the fabric to be easily accessible and many tools are built to nurture and help them grow like seeds into beautiful flowers. 

Likeminded people can rally together, have empowerment using the tools of openchat, catalyze etc - and BUIDL together.

Stomping down on the likes of GHOST because they were able to rally into something special is very, very bearish for the future of the IC.

Because by doing so, you are stomping down on your main userbase and usecase.

What rubs the wrong way is your impersonation of someone else with a fake account that you probably don't mind if it gets banned.  It's a cowardly act.  If you have something to say, then stand up and say it with whatever public identity you normally use.

Think about it-

What’s all the use of this amazing alien tech if the accessibility level is too high?

DAO’S on the IC are worked into the fabric to be easily accessible and many tools are built to nurture and help them grow like seeds into beautiful flowers.

Likeminded people can rally together, have empowerment using the tools of openchat, catalyze etc - and BUIDL together.

Stomping down on the likes of GHOST because they were able to rally into something special is very, very bearish for the future of the IC.

Because by doing so, you are stomping down on your main userbase and usecase.

This entire comment is a great example of an intellectually honest contribution to this conversation.  Why can't you do that with your normal public identity?  You are clearly an active member of the ICP community and have some useful things to say.  Why do you feel the need to do it with this new account that assumes someone else's identity?

I believe my opinion has been expressed perfectly and in more obvious ways than solely a long winded response. 

Certainly many people found it comedic, yet the point driven home.

Sometimes other forms of expression are necessary that can dig deeper than just words.

I see you are leaning on the forum guidelines and I respect that, because the discussion could easily get out of hand.

 Nevertheless, I will abide by the forum rules.

I don't mind KYC if it was perfect, but it's not.
You can check here https://haveibeenpwned.com/
The KYC data ends up somewhere and then it gets hacked and your info is packed in a db posted on the dark web for someone to buy.

Thank you everyone for the lively discussion and valuable feedback. 

One concern that has been brought to our attention is that the maximum sale amount should be increased from 20,000 ICP to 30,000 ICP in order to protect early buyers. 

We want to invite further input on this topic, and any other details in general, but also want to remind everyone to please keep it civil. We respect everyone's opinions!

The sneed developers are very sincere and transparent. I am an early participant of sneed, and I have witnessed the process of community self-initiated discussion and purchase of sneed. I highly appreciate the innovation of sneed's economic model. Sneed has inadvertently hedged against the high inflation of ICP in eight years, and as the burning intensifies, sneed will become as precious and rare as NFTs. With the establishment of such a SNS DAO, who can be sure that sneed will not create a great community and products like MKR in the future?

I wish sneed can be launched on SNS ASAP, and realize the automation of canister, LP, and staking ASAP, and achieve more innovation through governance.

Hope all sneed holders can fly to the MOON.

Can you do 10000-50000? It's nice to make a humble offering, but won't be nice if everything is sold out early, but will be nice when those who miss out spill over to the open marketplace.

Thank you so much for the details! Do you have a timeline on when you will launch a proposal?

The token economics of ICP is entirely inflationary. Although we accept this governance consensus, this inflation is a chronic depreciation for 1-2 year holders. SNEED has the genes to hedge against inflation as a derivative.

-------------------------

jennifertran | 2023-11-29 00:25:58 UTC | #105

We are just confirming the timeline on when the @Sneed team plans on making a proposal to create an SNS on the NNS dapp.

cryptodriver | 2023-11-29 05:58:30 UTC | #106

A question: How do you team deal with sale income? To put them into 8-year neuron?

-------------------------

Sneed | 2023-11-29 08:47:22 UTC | #107

The Sneed Team is currently finalizing the proposal and weighing in community feedback such as the minimum/maximum amount to be raised. Giving an exact timeline is difficult because we are carefully evaluating all details and technical requirements. If we would have to give a tentative timeline it would be Q4 2023 - Q1 2024.

-------------------------

Sneed | 2023-11-29 08:49:55 UTC | #108

This would be up to the DAO to decide.

-------------------------

Sneed | 2023-12-10 02:17:48 UTC | #111

Thank you! Yes, we were about to announce it here as well. We are being audited currently.

-------------------------

cryptodriver | 2023-12-20 08:50:44 UTC | #112

Waiting for some update from the SNEED team.

-------------------------

Sneed | 2023-12-20 18:22:47 UTC | #113

The Sneed team is currently improving the SNS dApp's code according to recommendations given in the audit.
You can see our progress on: https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp

Simultaneously, we are testing the potential SNS setup locally to ensure a robust launch. 

Thank you for your patience and we are looking forward to finalize and submit the proposal as soon as possible!

Looking back on the past, SNS1 carried the community's great DAO dream, and united the entire ICP community, developers, investors, and the foundation. Seeing the success of DKP today, I can't help but sigh with emotion. After a long bear market, ICP is now back on track and continues to strive to become the top 3 market leader in blockchain.

The SNS1 community once had an idea that SNS1 holders could receive token airdrops from more DApp startup projects on IC. However, due to various reasons, the SNS1 team at the time was unable to successfully execute in this direction. This is a positive feedback mechanism that can not only promote Sneed to be more valuable, but also help more and more new DApps grow rapidly. Here, I would like to ask Mr. Sneed if he can inherit this idea and make it a part of the SNEED DAO roadmap after Sneed starts SNS.

(two history links attached, which are all our experiences on SNS1. I hope every SNS project will achieve great development.)

SNS1 holders are receiving an airdrop from Neutrinite Dapp. 1:5 (10,000 SNS1 : 50,000 NTN) that’s 5 NTN tokens per each SNS1. There is still an airdro spirit with SNS1, I hope it continues. 
Sneed could also airdrop to the SNS1 too.

SNS is not for meme coins

-------------------------

Robert_Hon | 2024-01-05 15:32:31 UTC | #118

Blockchain and decentralized ledgers have fundamentally broken the boundaries between currency, stocks, points, and memes, allowing these data that are limited by centralization to flow freely and realize value in a decentralized and permissionless manner.

From the history of Bitcoin, is Bitcoin a meme? Is Bitcoin a sovereign currency? I'm afraid you may not be able to make a conclusive definition of Bitcoin yet. The most important thing is community consensus, as well as a consensus mechanism that is creditable, tamper-proof, fair, and transparent. SNEED DAO is currently moving in this direction. Therefore, your attribution of SNEED to meme is actually lacking in rigor.

Please believe that the DAO behind SNEED, as well as the entire community consensus mechanism, can bring concrete value to holders, including the ICP ecosystem.

-------------------------

Esfeso72 | 2024-01-08 18:33:07 UTC | #120

Many opinions about the SNEED SNS which is good for the IC ecosystem. The fact remains obvious that SNEED SNS proposal is great and is welcome 🔥

-------------------------

Sneed | 2024-01-16 12:10:46 UTC | #121

The Sneed Team is proud to announce that after months of preparation, including development of the Sneed converter dApp for converting from the OLD (currently circulating) Sneed token to the NEW Sneed DAO token (to be created upon successful Sneed SNS launch), testing, auditing, revising and auditing again, we are ready to submit our Sneed SNS proposal.

The Sneed converter dApp will be activated and filled up with NEW Sneed DAO tokens from the SNS treasury via DAO proposals after successful launch. 

dApp: https://4pk43-5qaaa-aaaag-qc44a-cai.icp0.io/

dApp source code: https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp
dApp audits by @skilesare: https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/tree/main/audit
Sns_init.yaml: https://github.com/icsneed/sneed_sns_dapp/blob/main/sns/sns_init.yaml
White paper: https://icsneed.com/?wp=sneed

We will be launching our SNS proposal shortly. 
The token allocation of the NEW Sneed DAO tokens will initially be 85% treasury, 10% decentralization sale, 5% Sneed founding team (this is the allocation specified by the SNS initialization parameters). 

However, because there is already an existing OLD Sneed token in circulation which will be convertible 1:1 (minus transaction fees) to the NEW Sneed DAO token created for the SNS, the following will end up becoming the actual allocation:
19.5% treasury, 10% decentralization sale, 10% Sneed founding team, 60.1% Sneed converter dApp, and about 0.4% Burned. 

The reason is that a majority of the NEW Sneed DAO tokens in the treasury will be sent to the Sneed converter dApp, so that holders of the OLD Sneed token can convert them to the NEW Sneed DAO token. 

The Sneed founding team will (after burning 500 of their OLD Sneed tokens) own 500 OLD Sneed tokens and 500 NEW Sneed DAO tokens. 

After converting their OLD Sneed tokens to NEW Sneed DAO tokens, the Sneed founding team will end up with 1,000 NEW Sneed DAO tokens, or 10% of the supply. 
500 of the Sneed founding team's NEW Sneed DAO tokens will be locked in a neuron with 8 months vesting time and 1 month dissolve delay, and 500 will not be locked. 

Thank you for your consideration and please feel free to ask any questions!

what's the SNS price ?

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2024-01-16 15:13:34 UTC | #123

10% for the founding team on a meme token. Hilarious.

We have now submitted our SNS proposal for the consideration of the ICP community after many months of testing, revising the code based on security recommendations and SNS-Testing.

We want to thank everyone again for the immensely valuable feedback!

Yea  great impact. Looking forward to what it owns

-------------------------

gatsby_esp | 2024-01-17 20:42:46 UTC | #129

From the proposal:

*I. Vision and Purpose*

*The core vision of Sneed DAO is to provide a community-driven ‘blank canvas’ model SNS DAO (as pioneered by SNS-1) to the ICP community and ecosystem.*

In other words: There is NO vision and there is NO purpose
What a terrible precedent this community is about to create, using the most powerfull DAO system just to make a quick buck.
I though this community after what has gone through was much more thoughtful.

The founding team claim 10% of the supply for themselves. At this prices it is about 300k$ FOR JUST COPYING A CHUNK OF CODE AND MAKING 3 MEMES.
Seriously?
Looks like Dragginz team wants more liquidity to dump on retail.

Dfinity should make an official statement with their opinion
