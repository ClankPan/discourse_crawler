To answer a question we got regarding the future of the current 8 year neuron generated from the RLL model operations:
In case of a successful SNS vote, the Sneed team will buy the neuron (https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/neuron/1035017514686924184) and send the ICP to the SNS treasury. A proposal will be submitted if the RLL model should be continued for Sneed.

Argentina's President Milei just criticized all forms of collectivism and central control for their detrimental impact on a free-market economy at the Davos.

So what? The OpenChat development team allocated 15% for themselves and 8% for Dfinity, yet users have not complained at all. Up until now, the OpenChat development team remains the most respected team in the entire IC world.
