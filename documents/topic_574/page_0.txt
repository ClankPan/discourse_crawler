Happy Friday!

V0.5.5 is now available for download :partying_face:

:gift: **What's new?**
* New logging capability that supports logging informational, warning, error, debug, and trace messages to a file in addition to standard error and standard output.
* Specifying the  `--verbose`  option generates logs that include debug and trace messages.
* Internal updates that are not yet user-visible to support future features.

:hammer_and_wrench: **Fixes:**
The 0.5.5 release includes internal fixes and improvements to the Candid user interface, the interface description library, and  `dfx replica`  command.

Cheers!
